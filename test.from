I've tried a few brands, and she has the same relationship with each of them: she'll eat if and only if she absolutely has to (and usually by that time, she's so hungry that she scarfs it down and throws up a few minutes later). When it comes to wet food, she won't eat anything but chicken. I just bought some of that Blue Buffalo dry food today that everyone always shills online, but I expect it'll be the same deal.

Sexuality is sexual orientation, ie. 'gay, straight, bi, etc'. *Sex* is the physical genitals/sexual characteristics you are born with. And gender is how you feel you are. Edit: also, there's more than just male/female, both for sex and gender. While those are the binary ones, intersex people (people born with 'nontraditional' or 'ambiguous' genitalia, ie not 'clearly' male/female) and genderqueer/genderfluid/agender/bigender people exist as well.

Listen, I am not an NYCFC fan and will not pretend their existence doesn't piss me off because of the Chivas bullshit that foreshadowed this happening, but I do not blame NYCFC fans for it. That said, Third Rail needs to go fucking mental.

Every support group does, but the Third Rail needs to be the leader on this. There is going to be a lockout, and it is going to be ugly, but once it is over, the fans in this league need to send a goddamn message that **this bullshit cannot, will not, and will never be acceptable**.  newlinechar    newlinechar  This needs to be Garber's Watergate, Lewinsky, and Teapot Dome all in one. He needs to be gone. He is hurting the league, and we need to send the message to our owners that Garber cannot continue as commissioner.  This needs to be a coordinated effort, and I believe the Third Rail needs to be the leader of it.
He went on a troll rampaging spree on this sub for quite a while. Made some baseless accusations calling all 'boston fans' racist and getting into petty fights with people on this sub. In addition to that, he got several of his accounts banned on here and the same on many other NFL team specific subs too. He was pretty unruly and hard to deal with overall. Also, did I mention the fact that he planned to 'expose this sub' because it was racist? Yeah....that was fun..

Nope. Hi.
&gt;But, looking past the naming convention, we already have the bulldog repeater and the name bulldog doesn't represent a long range fighter very well, which is the primary attribute of the deep space fighter.  newlinechar    newlinechar  So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO).  newlinechar    newlinechar  Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well.  newlinechar    newlinechar  There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)).  newlinechar    newlinechar  IDK, overall I like the name. I see valid reasons to change it and equally valid reasons to keep it, I wouldn't be opposed to either outcome. CIG will do what they think is best and I'll be happy with it.

I have no way to prove this outside of an ancient photobucket link, but I actually made the original one as well. The crappy TV picture was from my 360 that later RROD'd.

A heart charm isn't a bracelet, it's a piece designed to go ON a necklace or a bracelet.  Jay says he 'thinks' he bought a bracelet, but that it could have been a necklace.  He says nothing about buying a charm.  Also, he says he paid $70 - $80, not $120.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Also, it's not clear that the receipt is even for the heart charm; it could be read as simply a receipt for SOMETHING costing $119.95.

The only thing that I don't like about Cooper is that (based on what I've seen) he doesn't seem like much of a playmaker. Again, I don't watch a ton of college ball so I could be way off base, but he seems kinda like a Golden Tate type guy, and I don't see a player like that being worth a top pick. Obviously there's more to him than what I see since he's projected to be a top 5 guy.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I watched some take on Funchness and that guy interests me merely because of his size. 6'5' 230 or something like that!

I just can't wrap my head around that happening though. In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better.  newlinechar    newlinechar  TL;DR Ward won't be a 'Super Villain', he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him

&gt;I'm going to speculate wildly and say that under 20% of RDR posters have read 20 pieces of literary fiction in their lives, and under 1% of r/writing posters even know what literary fiction is. But everyone reads genre fiction, so it's much easier to get worthwhile feedback, even if it's just a personal opinion.  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  It's interesting that you brought this up, because I noticed that there's a substantial amount of animosity towards literary fiction / MFA writers here (even more-so in /r/writing), and that people conflate MFA work with 'cookie-cutter narratives' and 'purple prose', when in fact –and just look at recent graduates from the Iowa Writer's Workshop– many of the best (and most original) writers today have gone through the MFA system.   newlinechar    newlinechar  It's upsetting to see the general ignorance in this sub (and of course, the internet as a whole —this is already a very well-maintained garden), especially when novice-level attempts at literary fiction are met with half-serious 'oh you must be in an MFA program' comments. And then! To think that these same commenters have only published KDP Singles, if at all —and have yet to attract an agent, or complete a book / movie deal with a publishing house, or have their work looked at by a professional editor, or win a single grant, honor, or award for their writing (NONE of which requires that you 1) possess an MFA, and/or 2) write literary fiction). It's enough to give the literary fiction writers on this sub a persecution complex.   newlinechar    newlinechar  This is primarily why I was speculating about the possibility of a smaller, more focused sub.

We altered racist and sexist books and media by censoring the content. For example the N word was removed from huckleberry Finn. This is an was change because it simply requires deleting a single word. Where as inclusivity for lifestyles that do not align with those presented in the hypothetical novel would arguably alter the content the author was intending to portray. This could be seen as changing the underlying meaning of the novel which I see as as big of an issue as a heteronormative society. I am adamantly against censure for any reason especially when reframing the context of a novel so that a child or student understands it isnt representative of modern society is a cleaner solution.  newlinechar

In addition to achieving C++98/03 conformance, this made it possible to pick up TR1 and C++11/14 years later.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; The marketing never pointed out the HUGE disclaimer  newlinechar    newlinechar  On VCBlog, I [clearly said](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx): 'In VC11, we intend to completely support the C++11 Standard Library, modulo not-yet-implemented compiler features.  (Additionally, VC11 won't completely implement the C99 Standard Library, which has been incorporated by reference into the C++11 Standard Library.  Note that VC10 and VC11 already have &lt;stdint.h&gt;.)'  newlinechar    newlinechar  I do agree that 2012 had a bunch of bugs, for several reasons. The biggest reason was the huge influx of new code (TR1 in 2008 SP1, lots of C++0x in 2010, atomics/multithreading in 2012). Compensating for missing compiler features was another source (e.g. variadic templates). Working Paper churn was also quite problematic (e.g. this led to weirdness in &lt;random&gt;). In 2013, [we fixed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/06/28/c-11-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013.aspx) many of these bugs (and switched to real variadic templates), and 2015 will contain [even more](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/06/06/c-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-visual-studio-14-ctp1.aspx) fixes. (I'll be writing another VCBlog post explaining the fixes between 2015 CTP1 and RTM.)  newlinechar    newlinechar  Also, since people always ask: 2013 shipped almost all of the C99 Standard Library, and 2015 is completing the missing pieces, modulo extremely minor omissions (I could look them up, but I'm on vacation; IIRC it's a couple of the FP macro things, and tgmath.h which is irrelevant to C++).

The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February. The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper).   newlinechar    newlinechar  Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Long post but there you go.

my biggest suggestion is to not use rockin green.  I wanted it to work so badly for us but it really doesnt work at all.  Rockin green products are pretty much just entirely made up of water softeners.  You need a surfactant which is found in most main stream detergents.  What happens is 'dirt' gets removed from what youre washing in the machine and goes into the water during agitation.  The surfactant binds to the 'dirt' sort of like it being trapped in a little bubble.  So when the water drains the 'dirt' goes with it.    newlinechar    newlinechar  That being said my biggest suggestion would be to strip them, do a bleach soak, and start using a mainstream detergent such as Tide.

Islam is based on Christianity.

But the theory from our current one (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/2pdq06/i_thought_we_put_a_stop_to_dream_board_posts/cmvxrt8)), however is that the community is self-policing, meaning that problematic posts will be sorted out through downvotes as opposed to active moderation.

I'll second this. In some fields, a PhD is a great path to having many exciting and financially beneficial job opportunities. In other fields, it may actually hamper your job prospects because you'll have 4-6 years less industry experience than your peers, yet there aren't really many jobs in the field that would truly require a PhD. Then in some fields, a PhD qualifies you for only one thing: an academic job, in an era where 'academic job' has mostly come to mean 'adjunct with zero job security making less than minimum wage'.  newlinechar    newlinechar  So anyway, yeah.

I know this is an unpopular opinion thread, but Tim Duncan the master of fundamentals and minute restrictions was playing 39.3 mpg his first 6 years of his career.

Leave. Walk out of the house and go back home. Ignore any anger they might send in text messages, and don't answer phone calls from them. Then, put in an email the reasons why their pushing upsets you. Reiterate in the email that you refuse to engage in the conversation again if they bring it up, and you will simply leave again.  newlinechar    newlinechar  After that, steel yourself. They'll kick off and accuse you of disrespect and childishness for not having the conversation. Weather it and don't respond.

Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf?  newlinechar  * Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to 'catch up' and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast.   newlinechar  * Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not.

I chose the right one despite having a really high ping (from West-Europe). However, IMO we need to keep up the hype anyway.   newlinechar  The problem is that Valve can earn more money by investing in new skins/ operations than investing in Tick128. We need to change that. When there is enough hype around Tick 128 Valve will eventually think that players are willing to pay for better servers. As soon as the people at Valve change their priority from keeping server load low to increasing the level of playability there might be more changes on the way. [TheReal3st stated in another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2qnw8j/why_counter_strike_is_so_vulnerable_to_cheats/cn7wv7r) that things like a better anti cheat or even a new net code or audio engine might become possible once Valve changes their policy. I really like this idea.

My pup has definitely lunged at people before. My roommate was making noise in our unlit kitchen in a large black hoodie, and Chief was whining at my bedroom door to go investigate.

Chief was growling at them from the window, in typical GSD fashion, when the kids walked into our front yard and started barking back at him.

Chief *lunged* at them snarling, and they ran off before I could say anything.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Would Chief had actually followed through with a bite/attack if something (like my roommates voice or his leash) hadn't stopped him?

Chiming in here.  I actually worked on Poxnora as a designer for about 3 years, bridging between Octopi and SOE ownership.  The last part of your post, about power creep, is the biggest thing that will translate into hearthstone if Blizzard doesn't consider it early.    newlinechar    newlinechar  The business models for this kind of game demand the release of new cards, they simply don't make much money otherwise.  In order to make the new cards desirable it is very difficult to avoid bringing up the baseline of power over time.  One of the large factors contributing to the decline of Poxnora's balance and fun was the requirement to keep all cards in circulation at once.  This makes it increasingly hard to create new cards without resorting to complex new effects or large combinations of existing effects.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I think Blizzard should strongly consider breaking the game up into limited play sets as time goes on, assuming they continue with a business model built around driving users to acquire the latest cards.

&gt; It's not so much a catastrophic polarization as it is a slow legitimation of what used to be an absolutely unacceptable agenda.  newlinechar    newlinechar  To be fair, isn't this sort of a matter of perspective?  The kind of moderate-ish ethnic nationalism you see out of much of the new populist right in Europe would have been 'mainstream' conservative thought a generation ago.  It's also interesting to me that people like Marine Le Pen and Timo Soini seem to be having a lot of success outflanking the traditional center left parties on economic issues.  Many of those parties moved away from the economic left the past 25 years and compensated with more aggressive social liberalism to differentiate themselves from the opposition.    newlinechar    newlinechar  I would argue that much of the new support for the populist and far right in Europe is the result of them filling a vacuum the old parties left behind, not some new right wing trailblazing.  Add that to a bad economy stoking anti-establishment feelings and people are less willing to stay loyal to the mainstream parties.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell.

My argument would be his poor track record most seasons and his unwillingness to adjust his scheme for the players he has to work with. His defense was always predicated on a bend don't break mentality so there weren't a lot of blitzes. In 2011, it worked because we had an amazing line that could get pressure while only rushing 4. This year he should have blitzed more in my opinion because we weren't getting a ton of pressure rushing 4 which gave Qb's time to pick apart our depleted secondary. So while it wasn't his fault that we had a lot of injuries it was his fault that we didn't adjust our scheme to try and cover up those injuries.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Also, that's a solid username, have you ran it past Carol in HR?

Looked it up - looks interesting.  I never played Cities XL because when I heard about it, I heard the online MMO thing (I don't even know that I knew it had a single-player mode).

If it is, do you know if it will require a persistent Internet connection?
Even when you got better loot in Destiny, it just wasn't...fun. The guns didn't feel different or interesting, or change at all through the game.

GOOD NEWS  newlinechar    newlinechar  HE FINALLY GOT IT
completely unrelated to this announcement, beyond his method of communicating it.  More and more, I find myself disliking him as a person.  I like his books, Love his charity, but he kind of comes across as an asshole who thinks his farts don't stink (if you understand the phrase).  His foreword in 'Slow Regard for Silent Things', came across as someone saying that 'if you don't like this book, you just don't get it and aren't one of the cool kids'.  I follow him on twitter and he constantly says things on there that just come across as super douchey. For instance, he doesn't post that he thinks the new Hobbit movies suck, but that 'I'm trying really hard not to judge you folks who went to see the Hobbit movies.....'.    newlinechar    newlinechar  I'll buy doors of stone whenever it comes out and I'll continue to support Worldbuilders as its a fantastic charity, but I'm just not really going to be a fan of his anymore.

My mom got me one, finally, after months of begging, for Christmas.

I'm using it right now, and it's fucking wonderful. It took me literally four hours to get it in the first time (I hadn't read the part about holding the fold *as low on the cup as possible*, and it kept popping open too soon), but I'm on the second day now and you can't feel it at all when you get it in right (admittedly I'm gonna need practice, there is *very* slight pressure when you do it wrong), no leaking (I slept naked last night! No diaper panties! No Japanese sheets!

I feel like I get this from other women too - a lot of people assume I put a lot of work into my 'figure', maybe I'm wearing lots of padding or have implants, or that I'm on a diet and focused on my weight all the time.  And I feel like I don't look like a modest girl, because I'm very thin and have DD's, when most modest women I know don't look like that.

Basically, every single thing needs an Intelligence to be observing it at all times in order to keep it in a definite form and to direct it/keep it from dissolving back into quantum foam.  newlinechar    newlinechar  After an Intelligence has been active for a while (I originally wrote 'around for a while' but this is inaccurate, all Intelligences are eternal, but some just kind of sit around doing nothing while others explore their surroundings,) it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy, thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of Godhood. But the more you have influence over, the harder it is to observe every single individual particle.  newlinechar    newlinechar  So as you ascend in degrees of Godhood, you recruit other Intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you. As you evolve into a more and more complex entity, you recruit more and more Intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures.  newlinechar    newlinechar  There is a spiritual evolution, each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution. You organize a more complex spiritual (spirit = plasma/electricity or something very similar) form, then incarnate into a solid form that matches it. After accruing experience in that solid form, you return to a purely spiritual form and take what you've learned (learning is much easier in a material form) and evolve your spiritual body (with or without help, see below,) then re-incarnate, taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form.  newlinechar    newlinechar  In addition to reincarnation, there is resurrection.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Resurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter. The best of both worlds, without the limitations. Once you reach this point, you are ready to take the next step, which is to assist other Intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Resurrected beings can reproduce, and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own. They can re-organize spirits from lower forms too, for example a dog to a chimp. It's possible, though much more difficult, for an Intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body (JHVH did this, hence why He is called self-created.) Once an Intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way, it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state.  newlinechar    newlinechar  After creating spirit bodies, a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit. This is what Adam and Eve did. They voluntarily gave up their resurrected state, after populating the Earth with spirits, in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they (we) could experience the next step.  newlinechar    newlinechar  As Adam and Eve fell, so too did the Earth, from its former place of glory at the center of the Galaxy to its present position at the tip of the Orion spiral arm. Adam and Eve left the congregation of the Elohim (Hebrew word meaning the Gods, plural, not God, singular) to rejoin mortality for our benefit. Later, JHVH did the same, but whereas Adam and Eve fell to bring death on themselves, JHVH incarnated as the man Yeshua Ben Yusuf of Nazareth to bring eternal life on Adam and Eve and all their progeny.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The Egyptian religion depicts the spirits of sinners (those whose hearts are heavier than the feather of Maat) being fed to Ammit, the crocodile/lion/hippo goddess of chaos. Basically those whose choices have taken them to a moral dead-end are dissolved back into quantum foam to be recycled; this happens after they are given EVERY chance to take a better path.

Those look a lot like my first attempts too!  newlinechar    newlinechar  So, through trial and error I learned:  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.     newlinechar  * Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails.   newlinechar  * Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help.  newlinechar  * Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible.  newlinechar  * Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment.   newlinechar    newlinechar  These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.   newlinechar    newlinechar

Welding cast is always a pain. The sand used in the casting process always manages to get into the base metal.

You then grind all that crap off, and weld again. You keep doing that til you get a GOOD full metal weld in. Then move forward to the next section of build-up and do that again, and again, and again, and again.  newlinechar    newlinechar  So you actually weld the same area sometimes 4-5 times buttering the base metal til you get good fusion and good metal.

Also RIo-Cole 8 turn overs this game... EIGHT!!!  newlinechar    newlinechar  Our offense also goes to shit as you can see Bosh talking about it.

&gt; I see, I think I would like it as long as they don't make Hans the main villain of the show or something, in all honestly if they did a spin off I would prefer if they mostly left Hans aside. He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.

Yes: I am strongly disagreeing with that 'point'. I most strongly disagree that 'a phone meeting with... a dozen other members of the ... team' is not one of the most efficient ways to quickly track down a one-off bug involving time-zone/date shenanigans that may involve user environment wrinkles that may require the test machine to be quickly reset for another 'clean' pass at the problem.  You get to keep working and tracking down the issue while talking with the team: **this is a hyper-efficient approach to the problem**.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If someone comes into my office for an interview and says that this is not an efficient approach for a hot high-priority issue, I have grave concerns about that person.  Maybe you can provide an alternative better solution for 'each team member working directly on diagnosing and fixing their share of the problem while maintaining an instant line of multiway communication', but it's still excellent.  And someone having bad meetings at their company doesn't invalidate what was clearly and demonstrably a productive meeting here.  newlinechar    newlinechar  We can get into the meta of it sucking for MTGO to have high priority issues on a regular basis, but from a development and test perspective the response was bang-up and the criticism unfair and unfounded.  Give them a break: software is hard enough without throwing in the crazed rules of Magic into the mix.  Someone from the team quickly posting up 'thanks for catching this - we're working on it'?

This I think is what a lot of ppl advocating for horizontal progression forget, ultimately a vast swath of the community is gonna decide on the small handful of efficent builds and anyone who isn't running one of those is gonna get vote kicked from any duty/party finder they join. Horizontal progression is great on paper and opens up a lot of choices but unless each fight is dramatically tuned to effectively give different weights to different abilities, a couple sets will just eclipse the rest. Hell even the small amount of fights that might manage to pull it off will probably just frustrate the larger playerbase 'great i need a specific gear set or else no one wants me to join their X farming party better leave all that garbage on my retainer' etc. 
I don't think it's always a bad plan. They sound like classes for students looking to major in math so that they develop familiarly with mathematical rigor. To my understanding they are to be taken instead of the courses designed for use by all departments and in place of calculus requirements.

Considering how desperate Princess Anna was and how susceptible she was to one magical, romantic evening, Prince Hans could bank on the princess falling into the arms of the closest and only remaining loved one and the two would be dashing off to the altar.

In Letters, Tolkien, talking about a hypothetical occurring when the Ring is at Mount Doom, uses the term 'the Eight', mentioning that the 'Witch-king had been reduced to impotence'. He has been killed, but beyond that he has been laid so low as to be irrelevant from then on. However, it can be argued that being killed didn't release him from the power of the Rings, so he should still be around. He shouldn't find the natural progression of Man into Death until after the destruction of the Ring (some people argue not even then, but I strongly disagree).  newlinechar    newlinechar  The passage the two of you were talking about, I think, is enough. We don't need to look to other books, just to previous paragraphs. This is actually the second wraith in so many pages to pass above the Hobbits. However, the first incident (where, the clouds still thick, there is no visual description) seems to take some time. Frodo and Sam are described as crouching under a boulder and not speaking for some time, until Frodo finally senses it has passed. Before they start moving again, Theoden is stated to be at that moment dying.   newlinechar    newlinechar  With the second passage, the whole scene, a transit from far away . Perhaps a long pause, but still just that, with no indication by the author that any great deal of time has passed, like in the first Nazgul's flight. Even seeing it before they feel it (as was the only indication of the first), there's a speed that marks it as something different. The second passage ends with the statement that the Lord of the Nazgul is dead, and from the pronouncement appears to be making the same sort of claim of immediacy as it did with Theoden.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Given that, I lean more towards his interpretation. But I'm not going to say it couldn't be one of the other Nazgul flying like a bat out of hell to report. There's simply too much attention drawn to it for me to think we are witnessing anything left than the death-visage of Lord of the Nazgul.

You started this game after the new mechanics have been added. That adds a much steeper learning curve than most of us who started earlier. Tip: Download iZurvive and make sure you have a compass in game that is worn or pristine. (Look in fire stations). On iZurvive make a waypoint where you are and where you want to go. The correspond line will give you and ETA and it will give you a directional degree between 1 and 359. Then pull up your compass and line up in that degree. Once lined up double tap alt so you can lock your camera and auto run until said destination. PM for help if needed

If it makes you feel better, there have been times when I have been completely drunk and said things that I would never in a hundred years have every thought to say!!

AE is usually TTS so I'd say half size down. Unless you usually go half size down on the 65-last (Park Avenue, Strand, McAllister, etc.).

It is very hard to say.  Even if you had a 'twin' who matched you dose for dose throughout your life, each of you would have different experiences.  This is a strange fact of biology.    newlinechar    newlinechar  The good news is, at 10 days you should be out of the worst of it and every day should start getting progressively better.

This is an endeavor that gets better with more time.  1 year and you will be like a whole new person.

Don't worry about tomorrow, because it doesn't exist.  Don't think about yesterday because it is long gone.  All you have is now.  Now is all you ever had.  Deal with now.  Handle now.  Make now the best you can make it.  Make the best decisions possible now.  Keep doing that and months into tomorrow will fly by so fast that you will look back amazed.  Life is funny that way.

Okay, I think I know what bothers me about Yas's W and passive.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Yasuo's passive, Q, E, and R *all* create the cohesive image that he interacts with disturbances in air currents.  newlinechar    newlinechar  His passive gives the sense that 'Flow' is something that can be acquired and disrupted, right?  He gets Flow, and protective wind surrounds him indefinitely until his flow is disrupted, at which point it becomes turbulent, and dissipates shortly afterward.  How does it work?  I don't know, but I feel like, by moving through the air, he can sense what it's doing and sort of 'fit into' it, and that's what creates the normally-invisible shield.  When it's disrupted, he exploits that disruption to prevent damage to himself.  newlinechar    newlinechar  When Yasuo uses Q, he's also doing *something* with air currents, because it takes 2 of them before he's ready to use the tornado with his third.  Maybe he's reading the currents with his first 2 stabs, maybe he's priming the air (so more writing than reading) with them.  It makes sense, because something changes if he doesn't use the conditions that he's created within a few seconds: all of the prep work goes away, fickle as the wind.  If Yasuo stabs again, though, he can exploit some created or detected disruption in the air to create his tornado, similar to what he does when creating his shield.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Yasuo's E is a bit more proactive, in that, instead of exploiting an existing disturbance in the air, he forcibly creates one, and that prevents him from using the ability again.  He enhances his movement speed by slipping through the air *just so*, but can't do it again for a certain amount of time because he's changed the air he moved through.  This is why he can E again and again, as long as he has an air current he hasn't already disturbed: the limit isn't with Yasuo, but in the time it takes the air he's disturbing with his dash to return to normal.  newlinechar    newlinechar  What's more, while this disturbance is being created, Yasuo can exploit it: he can perform sword maneuvers that are beyond his normal abilities (the spin), and create a significantly-larger-than-normal tornado, though it doesn't travel.  newlinechar    newlinechar  When Yasuo's ult is ready, displacement effects give clear visual queue that they're creating, you guessed it, a disruption in the air that Yasuo can, you guessed it, exploit to benefit himself, this time in the form of extremely rapid movement (presumably aided by the disruption in the air), suspending his enemies in the air, and finally, gaining armor penetration, represented by a disturbance in the air around his sword.  There's a disturbance in the air; Yasuo exploits it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  His W is the only thing that doesn't fit.  While his E also forcibly manipulates air, it retains his common theme: he can use that disruption to benefit himself (enhanced Q) in some way.  With his W, however, he creates the disturbance and that's it, end of story.  He can't interact with it in any other way, and it's the only air-based ability in the game that he can't interact with (unless you count Janna's shield).  newlinechar    newlinechar  **TL;DR: Yasuo exploits and interacts with air disturbances, except the one created with his own W.**

Round 1 I would give to Azula 6/10, assuming Pikachu is taking orders from Ash, the lag between them would give her a big lead and make their attacks predictable.

This is an amusing post; and I feel like a lot of people making similar posts about ED on here these days would do well to look back on that.  :p     newlinechar    newlinechar  Back in those days, it took me something like a day of playing to complete my first successful flight from lave to another system, including docking.  But once I did it once, then it started getting *a lot* easier.   But you had to work to earn that sense of accomplishment.  It was *hard*, and so you really earned the satisfaction of even that simple achievement.    newlinechar    newlinechar  And at that point, a whole galaxy...eight of them, actually...opened up before me.   And I was hooked;  I didn't stop until I made *ELITE*.    I was a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a pirate, a pawn and a theif, and occasionally even an honest trader.  I would do the Reidquat run as a warm-up, and then look for a *really* dangerous system to hunt in.  Basically, I practiced until I was actually good at it, instead of quitting just because some feel-good sense of 'winning' wasn't handed to me on a platter like games of today do.    newlinechar    newlinechar  Back then games required real skill, and if you couldn't cut it, you lost the game, period.    And a little imagination helped, too; wireframe, or simple solid-colour polygons give you a canvas, and your mind had to fill in the details.   That is not really encouraged as much in the big games of today.     newlinechar    newlinechar  And for God's sake, if I see another post about how Elite is bad and should be more like WoW or Eve, I am just going to have to murder someone.   IF you think either of those things, it simply isn't the game for you, you know?     newlinechar    newlinechar  I wonder if any  other old-timers are kicking it in Bebece these days?  Is that system even in ED?  I guess I'll have to take a look.    newlinechar    newlinechar

You've probably already tried, but have you asked them to do a once weekly grocery list, checking everything you currently have before putting anything on the list? I'd also suggest collecting their receipts and totally their monthly expenses.

That's basically a second job though.

Can't comment on Anderson's defense as 61.7% is pretty bad but he's also on an oddly poor defensive team considering they have Asik and Davis as shotblockers. I'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. Stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with.  newlinechar    newlinechar  On offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. He's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. Montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat Anderson is. Montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had.  newlinechar    newlinechar  You also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. Stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... Dwight (Lewis in Orlando). It's also been a noticeable part of offense for the Spurs (Matt Bonner) and Suns (formerly Channing Frye) in the past. If Houston had the opportunity to trade Montiejunas for Anderson straight up Morey would have Montiejunas on the plane to New Orleans in a heartbeat.

Actually, the video itself is the context, the word you were no doubt searching for is there is no proof, or other conclusive evidence to suggest that the white kid is the bully. However, using context clues, one can make some general assumptions. For instance, the black kid's behavior does suggest that he is distressed, and taking into account the standoffish nature of the white kid, especially at the end when he tries to save face, not to mention the reaction of the other people present, which is obviously supportive of the black kid, it is not outside the bounds of reason to assume that the kid was indeed being bullied and responded in an appropriate and satisfying manner. Of course, it is impossible to be sure that the above mentioned scenario is the correct one, but I posit that it is probably the most likely of the other available explanations.

My dad has been an actively practicing Physician for over 26 years. Not much, if anything at all, phases him. He's always professional, and always reflects such.

My advice to not wasting time and money on square bitches is to focus on bitches that like YOU rather than bitches that you like. As soon as you've made a connection with them, profess your feelings for them first. If they get all gushy over you telling them that you feel a strong connection with them, then pull back a bit and get them to chase you. On the other hand if you tell them you feel a strong connection and they're like 'yeah whatever BUY ME SOMETHING' then you know they're trying to get you to chase them and most of the time, no matter how fine the bitch is, it won't work between you.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If you play things too slow waiting for them to build up a connection with you, it's a hit or miss game and you can lose a lot of time and money in the process. On the other hand, as soon as you feel you've put in a bit of quality time, if you right away tell them you feel that strong connection, you'll probably end up losing a large amount of your prospects in the process, but at the end of the day you're weeding out the ones that are too much trouble or effort in the first place.

Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language -- so the argument runs -- must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.

'So you worked your ass of since year one. It's year six now. Naturally, working your ass off is what we've become to expect from you, although all your colleagues do half of the work you do. So, again you didn't excel. Again, no bonus.'
&gt; Sure they do.  newlinechar    newlinechar  No they aren't. Not even light works the same way.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.   newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly.  newlinechar    newlinechar  What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.

I know 6-7 teams can still make bowls.  Not sure if Colorado would get the exemption though.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Edit:  Found the rules for what to do after all normal eligible schools have been taken.  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  1.  Teams finishing 6-6 with one win against a team from the lower Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), regardless of whether that FCS school meets NCAA scholarship requirements. Until now, an FCS win counted only if that opponent met the scholarship requirements—specifically, that school had to award at least 90% of the FCS maximum of 63 scholarship equivalents over a two-year period. In the 2012 season, programs in four FCS conferences cannot meet the 90% requirement (56.7 equivalents)—the Ivy League, which prohibits all athletic scholarships; the Patriot League and Pioneer Football League, which do not currently award football scholarships; and the Northeast Conference, which limits football scholarships to 38 equivalents.  newlinechar    newlinechar  2.  6-6 teams with two wins over FCS schools.  newlinechar    newlinechar  3.  Teams that finish 6-7 with loss number seven in their conference championship game (that has been eliminated by the conference championship waiver rule).  newlinechar    newlinechar  4.  **6-7 teams that normally play a 13-team schedule, such as Hawaii's home opponents.**  newlinechar    newlinechar  5.  FCS teams who are in the final year of the two-year FBS transition process, if they have at least a 6-6 record.  newlinechar    newlinechar  6.  Finally, 5-7 teams that have a top-5 Academic Progress Rate (APR) score. This was later adjusted to allow other 5-7 teams to be selected thereafter—in order of their APR. [11]  newlinechar

I was raised on a horse farm that had a lot of barn cats.  When ever one of them had an abscess, and it happened a lot, my mom would use a product called DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide).

Repeat daily until the wound is no longer infected and is healing well. My mom would vet us with it too! It does wonders for burns and muscle injuries.

I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;)  newlinechar    newlinechar  I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema.  newlinechar    newlinechar  But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises).  newlinechar    newlinechar  I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

Posted from an earlier discussion:  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; As an American I also dream of the day we start using metric and Celsius like the rest of the world  newlinechar    newlinechar  I grew up knowing both, use both.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The Imperial is best for things that have tangible feelings.  newlinechar    newlinechar  So, for the US, Fahrenheit is excellent. 50 degrees is jacket weather. 60 degrees is sweater. 70 degrees is nice. 80 degrees is warm. 90 is hot. 100 is oh shit it's hot. Though, once you get really cold, Celsius is better. 0 degrees Celcius is actually a good measure between 'chilly' and 'fuck it's cold'. But since I never lived in a place that was cold, I never had to use it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Feet make more sense for measuring people because 4 feet = midget. 5 feet = short. 6 feet = tall. 7 feet = NBA Center. Simple enough.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Cooking is easy with the imperial system. A cup is a fucking cup. A pint is two cups. Since I don't carry a purse, I like my beer as two cups. A quart is 2 cups, 4 pints. A teaspoon is a teaspoon, a tablespoon is a tablespoon.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Just go ahead and make a 'pound' cake. Super simple.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Being divisible by 3 and 4 is easy for cooking. Because rarely you have a dish made for 10 people.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Building is easy when it is divisible by 4 and 3. Many places kind of gave up on base 10 in construction - 120cm is a common length in building materials in some metric places. That's why 12 inches in a foot works so well.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The metric system makes sense in ways that don't have a tangible feel. Milliliters and milligrams are vastly superior to whatever the hell the imperial system has to offer.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Travelling can go either way. Running is easy. 5 minute mile - sprint. 10 minute mile - slow job. But Kilometers work as well. A 5K is a good light run for me. Driving in the US is generally faster, so miles work well. Outside is usually slower, so kilometers work well.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The metric system is great for quick, off the top of your head calculations. When it was developed, it was great because it saved time in calculations that the scientific community did by hand. Now, nothing done with precision is done by hand, so it doesn't really save any time for me.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The metric system is great because you don't have the confusing 'ounces' that could go by weight or volume.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The imperial system is great for another reason. When someone says that they don't 'Understand' it, or it is too confusing, I already know this person is an idiot. So it acts like a great buffer from the ignorant. Cause it takes 10 minutes to understand it and be fluent in a measurement system used by 20% of the world's GDP.

I mean, #3 'Creating Worker Co-ops' is kind of socialist. Not really fully socialist, since he's not talking about seizing the present economic structures but building competing ones, but bringing workers' ownership into the conversation is helpful. And the way #4 'Growing the Trade Union Movement' is described certainly isn't socialist, but the labor movement will be critically important in any future socialist movement, so strengthening it is important. And while #7 may be named 'Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers,' the upswing of fighting the NAFTA or TPP (even for nationalistic reasons) would be a benefit to global workers in sectors that would be marginalized by the kind of free trade that is implemented on capital-owners' terms.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The way I see it, Bernie Sanders certainly isn't the answer. He's still quasi-capitalist and supports some imperialist policies. If he runs with the Democrats, he'll be telling people that 'socialism' is a thing for liberals and that the right-wing Democratic Party is the place for 'socialists,' which will do a lot of damage. But if he runs in a socialist party, he can help build up a movement that will outlive him. He won't be around forever, and if he's used to make a socialist movement more popular, it can be taken over by genuine socialists. Sanders and Kshama Sawant have spoken together in the past, and as maybe the next most prominent socialist in government (though distant by comparison), she might be indicative of what the next generation of such a movement would look like.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't trust Sanders to be president. He would probably be better than a Democrat or Republican, but I don't play the game of arguing for lesser evils. However, I do think that socialists can use him to bolster the movement, so long as he's got enough of his old socialist conscience left to not enter the Democratic Party.

Some people hold the view that trans people *are* born their gender, and claiming that your physical configuration at birth is all that matters can be transphobic (ie, trans guys aren't really guys because they weren't 'born male'). Cis is better because all it means is your physical configuration at birth and your gender identity have always matched.

Haha! My personal motto is 'Nobody ever looks back on their life and thinks, 'I wish I'd had less sex'.'   newlinechar    newlinechar  Unfortunately 20 is a *bit* too young for me, otherwise I'd take you up on your generous offer. :)  newlinechar    newlinechar  So, I didn't go to school, and it hasn't been a hindrance for me. I figured with the 50k I'd spend on school, not counting the insane amounts of interest, I could get a head start on my investment portfolio. Fortunately for me I was right.   newlinechar    newlinechar  It also helps to be able to write and speak legibly: I'm a true believer that the gift of gab is worth its weight in gold.

And you're right, a business degree seems like a good choice. Truth be told I was never much good at school (it's hard for me to sit still and concentrate), so it was an easy choice for me to put my money elsewhere.   newlinechar    newlinechar  YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T HAVE TO END UP IN A BORING OFFICE JOB! There are plenty of people who enjoy the solace and anonymity provided by an office job - leave those jobs to the people who love them. Because if you don't, and if you would be miserable in such, then for fucks sake, don't do that to yourself. Even if you have a tough time finding a job - and believe me, I've been there - find something else with which to make money while you search. There are an infinite amount of ways to make cash, and the more you cultivate those, the better you get/the more money you make. For instance, I have flipped furniture, painted, sold things on ebay/craigslist, guest bartended ... really, there are so many things you can do to make money. The notion of 'The American way is to get a job in your twenties and work the same job until you're 65 and get your pension and live in your little house with your little wife until you die' are over, man.

That was a really interesting article, thanks for sharing. One of the things that turned me away from Christianity were the bible readings we had every week at church. I just remember hearing some of these stories like where everyone in Sodom is killed as if every last person (including, I assume, infants) is deserving of death. Then Jesus comes along and all of a sudden we're all supposed to love each other.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't know enough about biblical scholarship to debate some of the comments. But I find the argument interesting that the bible is our most historical document as we have so many copies. I've often heard that as an argument for the bible's infallibility. What I don't understand is how that in any way solves all the inconsistencies and contradictions within the bible itself.

&gt; We were remarking on how all new builds are so big and how it's so weird  newlinechar    newlinechar  Exactly. Ours is a 'starter home' and yet it's 1200 ft^2 , with an unfinished basement and a 3 stall garage. This is the only home we plan on living in now. Apparently, we'll be having new neighbors constantly since we're just in a 'starter' neighborhood. Ridiculous.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;My husband and I live in a mass produced 'cracker box' very much like the first picture. It's about 1100 square feet, built in the early 50s and solid as a tank.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I love these neighborhoods, and am jealous of you. We tried to put offers on a couple of the houses like these that were in decent shape, but they were sold literally hours after being on the market. You're correct in that these houses are in high demand. The weird part is that in some of these neighborhoods, people seem to be buying the houses to use as rental properties - and the quality of neighborhoods seem to be going downhill because of it. I would LOVE to see newer neighborhoods with these houses.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;When we first moved in here, we had the typical 'starter home' mentality, figuring we'd upgrade in five to ten years. We only have one bathroom, and while we have four bedrooms, they're small, and their number comes at the expense of a dining room and a living room that can comfortably fit more than us and a few friends.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Our newer house does have some advantages:  newlinechar    newlinechar  The basement has a large family room, so that when it's finished, it can fit all of our 'activities' - Our 8 ft. pool table, a gaming/board game table and chairs/couch, and my gun safe. We have those items in the basement right now, it just isn't finished off.   newlinechar    newlinechar  The 3rd stall in the garage will be my shop/woodworking area, so all the tools I have from my grandpa will actually be usable. With the small cracker box house neighborhoods, I've never seen more than a double stall, and most of them are single stalls; We want a garden as well, and a lot of the older neighborhoods have a pretty small lot size already.  newlinechar    newlinechar  When the basement is entirely finished off, we will have 2 more bedrooms and a 3rd bathroom. So, it'll be a 4 bedroom, 3 bath, dedicated laundry room 'starter home'. Still blows my mind that people think they need more than this. I can even use one of the basement bedrooms for a home office if I decide to quit working for someone else. We'll see what happens.   newlinechar    newlinechar  -----------------------------------  newlinechar    newlinechar  On a side note, 2 of the people that are married that my SO and I went to school with are looking at houses now. They're looking at a $450,000 house, 'but aren't sure it's big enough'.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Makes me want to throat punch them.

The specific velocity itself isn't important - that's just what it got set to, based on the way our universe is structured.  And of course the specific units we use to describe it are even more meaningless, because they're just inventions humans came up with to describe it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  But the basic reason why nothing can ever go faster than light, is that all motion is relative to other reference points (that is to say, if you are standing still and a car is driving by, it's equally valid to say that the car is standing still, and it's YOU and the entire planet Earth that are flying rapidly past it).  Once you wrap your head around that concept and accept it, the next thing you have to accept is that about 100 years ago Einstein did the math and figured out that for any two given reference points, the way you can describe how one of the points is 'moving' in relation to the other involves dividing 1 by 1 minus velocity squared  divided by the speed of light (c) squared.  The meat of that being that you have that velocity squared over c squared in the denominator, and being subtracted from 1.  Since 'c' (the speed of light) is a measured value, it stays the same in the equation all the time (and is a very very large number) - it's the 'velocity' that changes, based on what you're observing.  So now think about what happens when the 'velocity' of the thing you're observing is equal to 'c' - well it doesn't matter WHAT the specific number is, any number divided by itself is '1'.  So that equation I mentioned, that governs how to translate the observation of something from one reference point to another, suddenly becomes '1 divided by 1 minus 1' or '1 / (1-1)'.  But that means the denominator works out to '0', and you can't divide by zero - you just can't.  Math itself doesn't allow it to happen.  And that means that since the mathematical equation in question defines how the Universe works, then this is also something that *can't* happen in the Universe.  The math doesn't work, and so it can't happen.  newlinechar    newlinechar  That's the most basic theory.  But Einstein had other tricks up his sleeve.  He also used his equations on how to define things from arbitrary reference points and applied them to other known physical laws and theories, expanding those to accommodate relativity.  In doing so is when he found that E=mc2, for one thing.  But he also found that if you apply relativity to the calculus that governs how energy input translates into acceleration of massive objects, as the velocity of the object even *approaches* the speed of light, you suddenly start needing more and more energy to get the same level of acceleration.  If you plot this out fully you end up finding that the closer you get to 'c', the higher your energy needs become, without ever letting you actually *hit* the speed of light (let alone go beyond it).  You would theoretically need infinite energy to accelerate to the speed of light (but in the physical world, the word 'infinite' is meaningless).

I believe OP's parents live in a single family, detached home that is built into a hill.  The first floor opens up to the front yard.  The basement is like a cellar, but is accessible from inside the home and is often turned into an entertainment area.  In this case it is a walkout, so below ground in front and opens into the lower ground in the backyard.

Actually a common misconception about cats is that throwing up is normal for them. It's not. I have a 7 year old cat and a 3 year old cat, they never ever throw up. The older one threw up once, and we knew something was seriously wrong, so we rushed her to the kitty hospital at like 3am, and it turns out she had eaten Lilies (the flower). If you didnt know, lily flowers are so toxic to felines that even just the pollen on their fur could result in renal failure. (It reacts to their bodies the same way that antifreeze does). She ended up being fine, but only because we caught it so early and didn't brush it off as 'oh must be a hairball'. After the first two hours of lily poisoning the survival rate goes down to 20%. But I digress, vomiting in cats is not normal. Yes some cats have hairballs, but they really aren't *supposed* to. There are simple home remedies, and food types for them that will stop hairballs. Anyway moral of the story is, if your cat throws up, don't just assume that cats do that- make sure that kitty is alright!

So I figured things out and I'm going to do an ammonium cycle, I don't want to use fish food because I don't want rotting food in the aquarium...

No. I don't want to subject him to constant ammonia and nitrite fluctuations. I want a stable environment for him. In the meantime I got him a small 5 gal with a 25 watt heater and I'll be doing frequent water changes.  newlinechar    newlinechar  And lastly for the plants I'm just going to wait. I'm thinking I'll get them at the same time I purchase cherry shrimp.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I think doing this long cycle will give me time to research more into what exactly I'm doing because I honestly have no idea lol. Another reason I don't want to put him in right at the get go, for fear of killing him. My mom gave him to me as a Christmas present with this useless decorative betta stand and bowl holder. I just knew that it wasn't good enough, and I thought I might as well give him the best since I see him as a token of my mom's love.   newlinechar    newlinechar  But for some reason after one day of what little research I've done, I've become more knowledgeable than the employees at my local petland and big al's!!!!!  newlinechar    newlinechar  Anyway, thank you for your input.

I feel like Netflix series fit street level heroes better than normal films. They don't require as many special effects and they also have a longer amount of time to develop the characters.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If the MCU does get ahold of Spidey, it would be interesting to get a Netflix series instead of an actual film for him. Or-- if the costs to show Spidey's powers are too high, a Netflix cartoon series? But not one designed for kids or to sell toys, a more mature one.

I'm saying that I think the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the first team is greater than the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the second team. Gandalf is far stronger than Dumbledore for instance, and if The Doctor either can't get to the TARDIS or has it destroyed, his only option is pretty much putting all the energy of his remaining regenerations and exploding.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Anyways, yeah, I think Goku could stalemate Superman. But really, Vader/Dumbledore is a wash, Zeus is probably stronger than Thor, and like I said, Galdalf is just a beast and could probably negate The Doctor using the TARDIS.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up.  newlinechar

Hate speech is, by definition, speech (or writing) that incites violence against or intimidates a protected group. The judgment call on this seems like something that, IMO, should be left up to the admins and mods in respect to individual comments, rather than banning whole subs, unless the subs are actively and specifically dedicated towards inciting violence against people, which the ones that /u/HokesOne lists aren't (although damn I hate defending /r/whiterights, that shit is truly vile).

In AZ you can get a DUI for a variety of things that don't include driving. When I got mine, I was at a bar one night and had too much to drink. I called a cab to pick me up. When it got there, I had him stop by my car so I could grab my laptop bag that I didn't want to leave out overnight. There was a cop in the parking lot already, but I didn't think anything of it. He came racing over and busted me for DUI because I was 'in control of a vehicle' even though I was only grabbing a backpack out and it was blocked in the parking spot by my cab.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I ended up having to take several weeks of alcohol abuse classes among other things, because anyone who has more than one drink at a time has a problem apparently. During the classes we covered different cases of people getting DUIs and what could get you in trouble. Obviously don't drink and drive. But don't be in your front yard with your car keys on you if you've had a drink. If you're within a certain distance of the vehicle you're still in control of the vehicle. Don't drink a beer on a hot day while mowing your lawn, a mower is a vehicle. One guy got a DUI while trying to fix his car in his driveway. The engine didn't start, but he was drinking a beer while working on it. One old woman got a DUI after church because someone hit her and the communion wine registered on the breathalyzer as a .01 and she had a grandkid with her. That one was a felony because of the kid. Another person got a DUI after leaving a hospital and driving too slowly. She told the cop she was tired after working a double shift then visiting her sick mother. You can get a DUI if the cop thinks you're too tired, and she got her 2nd DUI that way even though she had nothing in her system.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Drinking and driving is flat out stupid. But a lot of the laws now are just insane and geared towards making the states money.

I don't interpret it the same way you do.    newlinechar    newlinechar  You seem to think that men have this idea that femininity is bad, but I see it more as femininity implies lack of masculinity, which is bad (for men). Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.    newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase 'you throw like a girl' is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to 'you don't throw like a boy.'    newlinechar      newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.    newlinechar    newlinechar  As far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.    newlinechar    newlinechar  It's all very silly, but things like this always are. I try to avoid those mindsets but none of us are immune from it. We're all just trying to find our way in a world filled with people telling us how to do it.

Oh man, high school. I was once sent to see the principal because a teacher saw me put my hand to my mouth and assumed I was ingesting some imaginary drug-- I had wiped my lips with a bit of napkin. People just refused to accept that I was that thin not just naturally, but in spite of my best efforts.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;I don't have the medical problems you do, so sorry you have to go through this, stay strong.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Thanks. In retrospect, I can offer the following advice that you are welcome to dismiss:  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Obtain and wear clothes that actually fit. I know that can be difficult, but well-fitting clothes really do make any build look better.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Stand up for yourself. Teachers may be authority figures, but as you implied there are definite limits on their authority, and more importantly there are limits to what is appropriate workplace behavior. 'This is my natural build. If you don't stop harassing me, I'll have to inform the principal.' (Say that politely!)  newlinechar    newlinechar  * This may be cliche at this point, but it really does get better. Almost everyone in high school is an asshole to some degree or another and eventually most of them grow out of it. In the meantime, try not to be one of those people as well, even if it often seems justified.

That's a bit extreme. I fully believe those parents had empathy for their child. Not only did their views on the transgender differ but the parent feared their child's soul was forfeit for questioning God.

When you see someone destroying themselves, which is what her parents saw, empathy will make you stop them at almost any means.

Exactly this  newlinechar    newlinechar  Maybe Ricciardo, Vergne and Vettel are the three best drivers in the sport, but considering Newey's track record, we can reliably assume who really won those 4 world champions, since those drivers haven't been team mates with anyone not in the red bull academy. At the same time with Raikonnen, he's been up against a few proven teammates, including Massa, and he did about as well as expected (maybe a little worse, but hey it was his first year in the car again) against Alonso as you would guess when you look at how he compared to Massa, so there wasn't much of a surprise there.  newlinechar    newlinechar  For that reason I think Vettel is still the more controversial driver, because he hasn't faced a number of known top class teammates, and neither have any of his teammates, so you can't really say how good he is since you don't even know how good his teammates and the former teammates of his teammates are.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Luckily, that'll all change next year, and if Vettel does anything less than stomp Kimi, the Alonso circlejerk will be full blast :)

What I find interesting about Buddhism is it's versatility.

The game wasn't willing to let you roam far enough in the levels to create a world. If you found two paths, they both lead to the same area, it's just that one involved more enemies but more loot. It felt like every room had a purpose for gameplay reasons, and anything that didn't serve the gameplay mechanics of the level was cut. To their credit, Eidos did a great job of putting a TON of world-building dialogue, memos, and posters in the world to try to make up for that, but there's still no real substitute for letting the player see portions of the world that exist for reasons other than gameplay.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm disappointed that the hidden cache chain of the City petered out too. That was the best thing they did in the open-world part of the game, completely un-gamey and relying solely on the player's map reading abilities, and they just let it die off.
I think for many the big draw was when Initial D first came out not many in the US knew what drifting was. They had never seen it, heard euro beat, or seen an anime that focused on racing. All of these things combined to fuel an entire movement whose effects can still be felt today.

So it seems we're clamoring that the shotgun isn't useful and needs to be buffed. But everyone's treating the symptoms of problem and not the core problem itself.   newlinechar    newlinechar  * Heavy's burst damage is limited because of the ramp-up penalty.   newlinechar    newlinechar  * Heavy's mobility is severely limited which causes him to get caught out of position a lot.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * His lack of mobility also causes him to eat more damage as he's limited in strafing or dodging the oncoming fire. This is especially the case when firing/spinning the minigun.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The natural/historical response to this is to use the sanvich to heal when the heavy has a chance. As long as his team is holding ground and he has cover, the heavy can replenish his health by remaining stationary for a specific period of time.   newlinechar    newlinechar  People are trying to make the shotgun more useful, but this doesn't really address the core mechanics of heavy and tf2:  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Increasing his burst damage or making him a fat scout doesn't in any way increase his mobility - allowing him to still get caught of position.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Multiple classes with greater mobility being able to dump well over 300 damage within a few short seconds still leaves heavy at a disadvantage.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * The problem with the shottie is that you can really only engage 1 person at a time. Compare this to stickies or rockets. A soldier/demo can place a rocket/sticky between two people and significantly damage both of them. Shotguns do not split damage like that.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Although the heavy's shotgun increases his burst damage, pushing a corner with a shotgun is an unsound move as there is no telling what's on the opposite side. Previously you could jump/rev and be ready. Now you have to spinup and prefire the corner: giving the opponents time to retreat and allowing you to burn through ammo shooting at a wall/floor.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Heavy needs a mobility/HP buff to make the shotgun viable. Holding his own against demos/scouts/soldiers/pyros with the shottie is suspect. Even if he kills one opponent, the damage he took in the encounter will likely prevent him from being able to survive the next foe he encounters without a healthboost.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Prior to the unnecessary, clumsy nerf. Heavy's ability to time ambushes made him able to take out more than one opponent while operating at reduced health. Soldier has the ability to ambush people from high perches he has jumped to. Demo has sticky bombs for traps. Pyro has the backburner and axtinguisher for ambushes. Heavy has a spin up penalty.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Simply adding a shotgun or weapon switch times only temporary increases his mobility. But he's still going to soak up damage, and he'll still be at a significant disadvantage to all the other ambush/explosive classes. This is why the majority of players will still equip the sanvich and deal with the atrocious ramp up penalty on their minigun. It's the best option for this nerfed class.  newlinechar    newlinechar

TBF, we sit on our labias, so the general idea is that male parts are in the *exact* same place.

TBH I see where he's coming from.

The same is true for PM though.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly.

Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

Yes, but there are additional effects. For example, heating from the Sun causes the atmosphere to change in size as well, whereas the purely gravitational effect from the Sun is smaller than that of the Moon. I'm not an expert on these things, but the one impact I thought of was radio communication because the [ionosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#The_ionospheric_layers) changes from the solar heating and you can bounce certain radio signals off the bottom of the ionosphere (since they don't propagate through). I'd be interested to hear other possibilities for impact.

I think it's your associations that matter, mostly. Linguistically, negatives are not very compelling, but visual stimulation that has a powerful negative or transformational association does.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I support your experiment and think it's great, especially if it works for you! I'll present a couple ideas for your consideration.  newlinechar    newlinechar  3 panel comic sigil, showing the thing, the process by which it is transformed, and the result (symbolically, or sigilized statements) for example 1. You smoking 2. The 'death' of your relationship to smoking. You can depict the spirit of tobacco as you see it, for example. The death of its influence on you. 3. The transformation of the habit to one you would prefer. Like instead of a smoke break, an 'outside breath break' where you take the time to center your breathing and awareness. Or whatever habit you prefer.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Using death in the sigil statement. 'My relationship to tobacco dies and is transformed' might be a way to get around the negative quandary. 'My awareness destroys my relationship to tobacco.' Don't be afraid to use powerful and evocative words, they may also provide more inspiration for the form of the sigil, as well.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The underpinning of these ideas is working with the Tarot as a language for sigil construction, because it has concepts of transformation and destruction already visually depicted but inherently lacks negatives, at least from a linguistic process. Haven't fleshed this out yet, I'm sure others have done it.  Just think in terms of processes by which something might change, vs simply saying no.

This is really kind of blowing my mind. Looking back at the Occupy movement, we saw police out in full force in every city that was hosting an event. They pepper sprayed, arrested, and threw people's belongings in the trash.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Why can they not use those same tactics on these people? What is different? It can't just be about the protesters violent reactions. The police are supposed to be able to combat that. All it tells us is that in the future, the best way to protest is to be violent about it.

They've been doing this in Lakewood for a very long time.   newlinechar  The population of that town has doubled to 90,000 as of the last census because of the number of Hassidic attending the yeshivas there.   newlinechar  They have also been caught blockbusting in Brick, Toms River, and Jackson.

That's true, hadn't really thought about the attack exp, however a lot of obby maulers (including pures) end up with 16 attack, either from that quest or from death plateau for climbing boots.

My little brother has paranoid schizophrenia and when he is on his meds he is the nicest person you will ever meet, but if gets off them it gets real bad. For example, there was a time I was out of work and lost my job and car. So he let me stay rent free at his place, sold me a good car for about 500$ and got me a job. If it werent for that I wouldnt have what I have now. However, last year he was off his meds and ended up going to jail for a year. It was because he was curious what our youngest brother looked like from the inside so he chased him down the road with a knife. Luckily there was a cop driving by or Im not sure what wouldve happened. I would hate to see him on meth or crack. Schizophrenia is some scary shit.

Getting that position was already a struggle and I know many people would kill for it. Still, it's paid really low.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Anyways. My mom has always been hot blooded. She tells hurtful things and then regrets it, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. I came to my parents for Christmas. My dad is very sick so I needed to help my mom with everything. And I did. I think she was glad I came only because of that. I was my Name Day on Christmas Eve and my birthday on 26th. She didn't give a shit. I didn't get anything from her, not even wishes. She is only nice for me when she needs some help, but she doesn't give anything back. It's the worst when someone is comming over and she wants to show off. The holiday season was full of visits and it got really frustrating to prepare everything, yet not even hear a simple 'thank you'. On Sun we had guests over - a couple with a kid, so she locked my dog in a room. Sure, the dog isn't accustomed to it, but we didn't know how our guests feel about dogs. But they were OK, actually they wanted my dog to be out, but my mom says no, because the dog annoys her. The guests kept peeking into that room, so the dog was barking constantly and my mom yelled at me. I had to take my dog for a long walk despite the darkness and frost. I wanted to go back to my place right then but I had drunk some alcohol so I couldn't. I told her how I felt about it, but she didn't react at all.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Today she was all nice as she invited four people over and she needed help with preparation. I did a lot, went shopping with her and spent half of the day in the kitchen. She cleaned the living room and locked it as she didn't want the dog to come into it as she would shed some hair... When fist guest arrives the dog was excited (she knows them and they're OK with dogs), so my mom locked her in another room. She started to whine as she was afraid of the fireworks and wanted to be with us. But my mom said no. I said that in such a case I'm going to spend the whole New Year's Eve in the separate room and my mom said she's fine with it, which was really hurtful, as I helped her so much and yet she cared only about the guests. I told her that. Then she said that it's her place and if I don't like it, I can go fuck out of there. So I started to pack myself. She didn't stop me only said that she's fine with it and added that I might as well not comming again any time. She was furious, probably because the guests saw it all. Then she started to cry, but I just left. When my uncle and aunt arrived (I was already on my way), they called me and asked me to come back, but I didn't want to. After I arrived at my place my mom called me and asked if I arrived safetly, then she gave the phone to my aunt who said that my mom is as she is and I should pay no attention to it and just come back. I didn't.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't feel good about it. But it was just enough. I felt like I'm some sort of servant the entire time. I feel unloved and unworthy, not even my mom shows any affection towards me. It all might seem really silly, but actually it runs really deep.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade.

A small group of owners owns them and utilizes them, and they get wealthy while nothing else happens economically.

I tried to explain it further down, but it's not something I completely understand myself. I mean, socialisation comes into it - people tell us that we have to be manly and mock us if we're not.

Just look at how many movies there are about becoming a man (Mulan doesn't count).    newlinechar    newlinechar  However, since manliness is mostly a social construct and the gender divide is reducing rapidly, it's hard to see what it is to be a man.

It's not as simple as that and you know it. A person can choose to do a great many things. A woman could choose to wait until she has the baby and then smother it and throw it out in the trash. Some cultures and beliefs systems include that as a valid choice. However to a woman who believes that abortion is murder, the abortion as a 'choice' it's no different than waiting until the baby is born and killing the infant at that time. It's not a valid choice for her. She could do it and then live the rest of her life believing she had murdered her own infant. Many would rather die themselves than do that.
I guess they figured the backlash from people who don't play Fire Emblem games (and probably most people who *do*) about including *another* blue-haired sword guy would have been too much. So a blue-haired sword-*girl* is at least slightly better, plus Lucina gets the waifu vote from a big percentage of the fanbase so overall the masses have been far more placated.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Robin was kind of a no-brainer solely for being the MC of a game and *not* a blue-haired sword guy (although I guess you can totally still make him a blue-haired sword guy if you want); at least you can give him/her some magic attacks.

Thank you, I'll check out those links.

I definitely agree, you laid out all of the shitty things about clubbing in general. If you got a stable and you're making serious money clubbing once a week with your bitches is a must. Bitches need to blow off steam, they love getting dressed up and when you got a big booth in VIP with 4-5 of your bitches and a couple close friends it's a lot easier to pull in high end talent.  newlinechar    newlinechar  With that being said if you're just starting out and only have one bitch and on a tighter budget, then trying to beat out every other swinging dick in the place puts you at losing odds in the first place. I'd never really try and spit game at a club in any situation though. All I'd do at clubs is follow these simple guidelines...  newlinechar    newlinechar  1. Post up and look for eye contact.  newlinechar  2. Approach when the time is right. Approach the bitches that are looking at you, not the ones you're trying to force eye contact out of them. If you don't get any looks back on a regular basis it's you, not them. Hit the gym. Buy better clothes. Smile more.   newlinechar  3. Keep game very simple, be polite, introduce yourself. Lots of compliments. Ask them questions. Be sincerely interested.  newlinechar  4. When the right song comes on, ask them to dance. Don't treat them like your sister but don't escalate things just yet.   newlinechar  5. Once you've danced for one or two songs unless she is giving you VERY strong signals, end it right now. Tell them you feel a really strong connection with them and you'd like to see them again. Get the number and then give them a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Text her right in front of her to give her your number back.   newlinechar  6. Your work here is done. Leave the club. Again, if she was acting like she wanted more, keep the text conversation going. If you go to another club let her know you left because you had to meet up with some friends. If she keeps texting you, you can head back to the same club where she was at and say you ditched your friends to meet back up with her. If she's not texting you back then don't text her again till the next day.  newlinechar    newlinechar  At the end of the day that's how it's suppose to work, but a prospect like this will only turn into a money maker I'd say about 1 in 10. You also have your off nights where you don't get any eye contact or when you do, your approach doesn't work. Or when your approach works, you tell them you feel a strong connection and then get a cock blocking best friend come up and steal her away. etc. The point being I don't mean to give anyone the impression that the above is a fool proof system for pulling in bitches every night. It's just what I would do and it worked enough of the time to keep on doing it.  newlinechar    newlinechar

Sounds/looks like a possible gas valve or pressure switch issue.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If it only runs for about 2 mins AND the blower(big motor in the bottom compartment) kicks on at some stage during this then it's unlikely the high limit temp will be reached in this period even with a weak switch.  newlinechar    newlinechar  It's hard to tell but there's a definite and immediate clicking when the flames go out. To me that could be a weak coil in the valve. Although with stuttering flames it could be a pressure issue somewhere.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Check the rubber hose going to the round metal disc thing in the top left. Make sure it's clear. Does it click at all during the issue? On startup, the small inducer motor (at the top) will run and cause the pressure switch to 'click' once but that's all you should hear.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Also there may be an error code, if you look at the bottom panel is there a little porthole to look inside? Can you see any LED's? Are they flashing when it locks out?

On days when I wash my scalp I get more tangles than usual. I'm not sure what your hair type is, but after I wash and rinse the conditioner out, I'll add another round of conditioner that I use to detangle, then leave in for a while to absorb into my hair. When I detangle I lean my head to one side so my hair hangs free and start gently detangling from the ends of my hair and work my way up. I gently coax apart the knots and glide my fingers between the strands a little at a time. Then I rinse all the hair out of my hands (yuck, right?) and lean my head to the other side and gently detangle again from the ends and working up.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I wasn't sure from your OP if you detangle from the ends up or from the roots down, but if you've been working your way down try starting from the ends instead.

THIS is the problem right here. All the medical and recreational laws only allow you to smoke marijuana in the privacy of your own home. They do not allow you to smoke in the hotel, they don't allow you to smoke at work, you can't smoke at a dispensary, you can't do anything like that. So when you're away from home on any extended stay, you either have to break the law or go without.

In general I agree with the whole 'encourage the trades' thing, but it shouldn't be the only conclusion people draw. My office just hired 3 entry level positions, but they were certainly hoping for a mid-level hire in at least one case.

Ya, now that the interview is done, I absolutely don't agree with any praise of NVC.  I agree with asking the easy open-ended questions and letting the person just get it out.  But eventually you can get past that and ask actual questions that need to be answered.  Instead, she just let Jay bitch and moan about everyone in his life the whole time then just ended.  The 'toughest' question even came with such a bullshit lead-in.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I get that there may have been preconditions for the interview, including no hard questions.  If that's the case, she could deny the interview instead of acting like she is reading questions pre-written by Jay's attorney or Urick.  If that's not the case, maybe be a journalist and do some thinking to figure out what questions should be asked.  You came up with a great list and aren't even getting paid for it.

That's not a real reason, though.

Well... interestingly, if you have potatoes, then you have sugar.  newlinechar    newlinechar  A bag of potatoes is essentially just a bag of sugar!   newlinechar    newlinechar  That is because potatoes are mostly starch.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Starch is a sugar.   newlinechar    newlinechar  (Starch is long chain molecular sugar).   newlinechar    newlinechar  We don't think of starch as a 'sugar' because it doesn't taste sweet... but this just means that not all sugar is sweet tasting. Some sugars, such as starch, are bland tasting.   newlinechar    newlinechar  So the next time your wife/girlfriend sends you out for a bag of sugar, and you come back with a bag of potatoes, then you can, scientifically, argue that you got her precisely what she asked you to get, and that she should have been more specific as to the molecular-length of the particular sugar molecules she was seeking...   newlinechar    newlinechar  On second thought, if you want to... you know... later that night... then just get her the sweet tasting sugar!

Fuck the people down voting you. A grilled cheese sandwich has cheese as the focus and a melt has it melted as a garnish.

Thanks. Sometimes I really let myself down by having a tantrum, and I'm always embarrassed by it. I still have them sometimes.   newlinechar    newlinechar  For example at work the other day something wasn't going right for a client and he had to get on a flight in half an hour. I knew how to fix the problem with his laptop, that he needed for this trip, but I also knew there was a chance it could royally screw everything up. So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving. She says 'NO FOLLOW ME!' and I yelled at her. 'NO I CAN'T, I'M BUSY!!'. I apologized later and told her I was in a very peculiar mood and should never happen. Its just that my dad just drowned a few months ago and I've been at the extremes mood-wise.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Another dude totally fucked up his order for new employees computers and when they didn't show up, I found that he had ordered only 1 and put in the comments 'I need three of these'. That doesn't work, you need to order 3 systems if you want three. I threw my hands up in the air and scoffed. I realized that was rather rude of me, and again apologized later in the day for my response.   newlinechar    newlinechar  3 years ago my little brother died unexpectedly and 2 weeks later I was with my spouse in the store and we got separated. As I wandered looking for him and his friends in wal-mart. I was getting more and more upset. I was getting so stressed for no good reason (just emotional) and punched a hole in a box of merchandise. Finally found him and started crying that I couldn't find him and I was angry.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I know I have problems with my emotions coming out and constantly working on ways to deal with stress. Its a battle I'm winning every day. I really do try.

I see a lot of answers about free will, and that's definitely part of the answer, but here's one thought to throw into the mix...  newlinechar    newlinechar  After The Fall, God removed much of his presence from the world, which essentially changed earth from something completely good into something that is increasingly twisted. That's the outcome of betraying God in that way. That's why we see not only things like murder and rape, but also things like natural disasters killing thousands of people--it's a byproduct of the Fall that God no longer offers the same protection that we would have if we hadn't betrayed him. This means that terrible things are going to happen all the time. There will be a time in the future when God returns the fullness of His presence, but that will begin with the world accounting for the evils they have done against Him.  newlinechar    newlinechar  And, strangely enough, while we live in a fallen world where sin is still present, if God protected everyone from anything bad happening to them, he would be supporting all the evil in the world that would normally have entailed consequences.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm sure this doesn't answer all of your questions, but I think these are important pieces of the puzzle.  newlinechar

This is a weird meme that has gotten traction in some political circles. No, there was some token assistance from the Chinese, but the Chinese were not huge fans of the Vietnamese. They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive). The soviets were not on much better terms, and between their lack of interest on the one hand and their inability to project geopolitical power outside their near-abroad on the other, they didn't do much.

I just don't remember a huge amount of OBJ hype pre draft, at least nothing at a level that would suggest he could be the best WR in the league in no time at all, and teams were idiots for passing on him.  newlinechar    newlinechar  However, I just maybe salty because the Browns didn't pick him.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Edit: Thanks for tracking that link down btw.

Quite honestly, it's a click baity type article that sounds like it was written by journalism student.  Maybe it is directed to current university aged students where maybe it makes sense?  Seems like a lot of drivel like most top 10 lists - except didn't think this one was clever/humorous.

8 years huh, he lived a good life with you it seems. I've read they typically average 5-10 years, with some reaching 15+. He looked like he was in great condition. He had some really nice markings.

No, but the thought of queers stepping up and calling the shots on what queer liberation looks like is apparently threatening to you. We don't exist to make straight people comfortable. If you want us to package everything in a way that isn't uncomfortable to you, then consider the fact that just *existing* as a queer person is discomfort so great, many of us end our lives. Seems a little imbalanced for you to be asking us to be nice-nice when people are dying over this shit.
You are doing so well to distract yourself but if you run out of things to do, feel free to message me.

Reload usually reduces the cooldown of 1 spell by 1 hour. When energized, it affects the last two spells instead.  newlinechar    newlinechar  You need to reload twice to reset DR. However, after the first Reload, the last spell used isn't DR, since Reload counts too. That means your last spell is Reload, and your second-to-last is DR.    newlinechar  If you use a non-energized Reload now, it will reset its own cooldown and then go on cooldown, effectively doing nothing. You need to energize it to reload itself (without effect) and DR.

My favorites were the stories by Jean Ray, Eric Basso, Kelly Link, MJ Harrison, Kafka, Lucius Shepard and Gahan Wilson
Operating the massive Fomorian vessels is not an easy task. Fomorian Commanders are forced to undergo severe body modifications and are grafted to their ship, forced to fall with their sworn quarry should they fail in their mission. Due to the intense load on the body and the high levels of radiation incurred from operating a Fomorian, many vents and nutrient tubes sprout from the Commander to constantly recycle his interior waste and bodily fluids such as blood or augmentation byproducts. The Fomorian Commanders control most of the ships functions through their augments, but a console for basic commands such as firing, self destructing, or venting radiation exists below so that standard crewman can operate basic needs should the Commander die before the ship. The Commander lives in a large chamber with a clear view into space. The commander is suspended by a complex system of machinery that allows them to maneuver across the cavernous control room with ease. The control room contains a wide assortment of interfaces that are only accessible by the Commander and his elevated position, and the basic control panel sits atop a large pillar in the center of the chamber connected by a single walkway. Overrides, direct interfaces to various parts of the ship, and status terminals are just some of the exclusive controls for the Commander, and even if another was able to reach their positions on the walls of the huge chamber, only the Commander possess the necessary augments to interface with them. Thus, regular crewmen are forced to wait for rescue should the Commander die. More often than not, the command from on high is to activate the self destruct override on the base console to prevent Fomorian technology from falling into enemy hands.

&gt; That 'right wing' 'populist' movement is her biggest risk factor for the next elections.   newlinechar    newlinechar  No, it's not. Right now, the CDU is at over 40%, because over the last couple of years, Merkel took many political positions from SPD and the greens and made them he own, taking away many votes from those parties. If she tried to cater more to the far right and populists that are currently voting for NPD and AfD, she wouldn't gain all that many votes (because for many of those people, the CDU is one of the big bad mainstream parties that they don't *want* to support any more), but would lose a lot more votes from the center and center-left.

The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.

There is probably a short transitioning period. I remember when whe changed to euro when i was a kid. It was tough bit to swallow for older people as it was more difficult for them to learn a new currency.

Yes.  Any type of fantasies are 'normal,' including having none at all.  Or, it's possible she knows she doesn't want to act on her fantasies and prefers to keep it private.  For example, she might fantasize about being tied up and dominated, but be horrified at the idea of actually doing those things.  It's hard to say.  newlinechar    newlinechar  As for sex with you not being good, don't jump to that conclusion.  I have been the lower-libido in a relationship before (I prefer once to twice a week, but can easily go once a night.  He wanted multiple times per day, including long sessions that my body could not  tolerate.).  It wasn't HIM at all.  It was me and my preferences and body.  Even if she only wants sex once a *year*--- is that sex wanted with *you*?  That's the important question.  newlinechar    newlinechar  As for getting her to be more sexual--- so much goes into this.  Of course, complaining, whining, coercion, ultimatums, shaming, etc Do Not Work (not saying you do or would do these things, but I always throw it out there).  For me, I feel more and more sexual with my partner when he or she creates a 'safe space' in our relationship.  No negative language, plenty of positive language.  Plenty of connection and talking about our sex life.    newlinechar    newlinechar  It's also entirely possible that sex is just not a priority for her.  If that's the case, acceptance, moving on, or agreeing to open the relationship are the only three ethical options (in my opinion only).    newlinechar    newlinechar  Hope this helps ad good luck!  :)

I had a bank account with USAA that only existed to feed my USAA car insurance. When I got out of the military I updated my information on their site (bank/insurance website is combined) when I moved my car and needed to update my insurance info.   newlinechar    newlinechar  All goes well till I get an automated phone call saying my insurance is going to get canceled if i don't respond. The bill was around $600 every six months and at the time I thought I was payed up till the end of the year but they changed some billing something and I found out that when the billing had come up, I was $30ish short. I didn't find this out as it happened, apparently many months ago the insurance side had been billing the bank side and coming up short, so the bank was deducting $60 twice a month from the account for telling the insurance side of USAA no.  newlinechar    newlinechar  This apparently was an OK arrangement for several months until the bank realized I didn't have any more money in the account to get another $60 fee out of me, only then did the insurance decide to call me. A call to insurance and they tell me that not only do I need to pay for six months like usual, I owed them money for the last 4 months my insurance paper has been technically valid and they haven't been getting paid. The bank said they can't do anything about the money lost in fees, as they notified me many times by sending a letter to an obviously overseas military address while my contact info on their fucking website is correct in every way.  newlinechar    newlinechar  TL;DR I think the USAA assumed I had died and drained my accounts, couldn't get any help after as according to them it was all valid.

It's not that I dislike it for straying off the Metal Gear path, but I just think that it's really bad at what it's trying to be. If you take Metal Gear out of the title, you're left with a pretty generic hack 'n slash QTE fest, which's unique sword mechanics are not enough to carry the rest of the game. It's definitely a weakling, when compared to other entries of the genre, in my eyes. But I know that a lot of people like it, so maybe it's just me, who can't get into it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If it doesn't count, then it would be MGS4 I guess.

I wouldn't use this mastery. Everyone else has a consistence source of gold income, supports rely on passive gold, gold from their item, and kills/assists. Everyone else has something to farm apart from you, and farming is the most efficient way to gain gold, so the support taking the kill gold isn't a bad thing, it just means the team gold is more evenly distributed. It's better to have 5 reasonably farmed champions over 1-2 super farmed champions and everyone else underfarmed.

I've been playing for about 2.5 years I know the frustration. When league was first made it was a small title that just so happened to be made at the right time. Thus it blew up, much faster than riot had anticipated. I play with an average of 95-100 ping. However if I play on LAN I get about 30-35 ping.

Alternately you could do a dry cure instead of a wet brine.  Takes a bit longer, but it would allow things like maple syrup to actually shine through instead of just being hopelessly diluted.  newlinechar    newlinechar  A tablespoon or so of kosher salt per pound of meat, plus a teaspoon (per pound) of a mix of whatever spices you think will go good.  In this case I'd treat the maple syrup as an extra, and add it in addition to that tsp/lb of spices.  Maybe a tsp/lb of it as well, but I'm not sure - I'd probably just wing it, going for a paste consistency.  Then rub the whole mess on your loin, wrap it in plastic and put it in the fridge - flip it once per day, until it's given off a bunch of water and turned your cure into a syrup (probably 2-3 days?)  newlinechar    newlinechar  Of course, if this were *me*, I'd introduce some pink salt into that mix, and go for a 6-7 day cure time, and make it into a proper Canadian bacon.

a.k.a. a flour sack, a construct of woven burlap, tubular in shape, with a flat sewn lower double seam.

Burlap, also called Hessian, is a rough and durable fabric made from plant fibers, usually jute or sisal.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Once, empty, they make good sleds. The rough fibers trap snow and ice which makes for low friction while giving good grip for the rider. Ditto for hard surfaces. A rough solid weave makes for low area of contact.

I think your nose is just fine. Yeah, it's bigger than average, but so is mine and my wife's (in fact, my wife is attracted to people with big noses, but anyway....). There are a lot of ethnicities known for bigger noses, including Arabs, Persians and Italians (I have many friends from those ethnicities). I don't know, to each his/her own, I guess, but I think reshaping it through cosmetic surgery would not be very high on a list for what you can 'do better,' as you ask, since it's not disproportionate at all to your face.

I'll give it a shot! So they both start with 501 points and the aim is to get to 0. Incase you don't know the small outer coloured band means the number he lands on is doubled and the small inner band means it is tripled. For the first six darts he tries to score as many points in as few darts as possible, by aiming for the treble 20 (the most points available in one dart). Then with the final three darts he finishes off the remaining points (treble 20, treble 19 and double 12) therefore going from 501 points to 0 in the lowest possible number of darts. Hope this makes sense.

No, I absolutely agree that informed consent to suicide is a real thing that ought to be respected. But in general, queer suicides are produced by a vicious culture that systematically denies queers their identities or right to exist. If the culture shifted, many of the queers who are pushed to suicide would not make that choice. And to ignore that nuanced difference is to excuse hetero-patriarchy and its violent ramifications.

The key is double trapping each beast. With 3 friends they all double trap the same beast. They are getting 6 crates per beast. Lets say they stockpile and want 100 crates on each character to last them 3 weeks. Thats going to take them 50 beasts. Since double trapping is OP, and they have 3 people they can knock out 50 beasts in under a hour. Do that on 6-7 characters each over the course of a week. Now you have no need to go trapping for 3 weeks.

Supposedly there's a [difference](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201401/how-tell-sociopath-psychopath) between psychopath and sociopath, with the psychopath not feeling much emotion from birth and the sociopath generally experiencing a traumatic event which triggers psychotic break and the disassociative disorder.

Once the vehicle is immobilized, it becomes the property of the police department in the sense that the driver is not permitted to move it without paying their outstanding fines or, for unusual cases, receiving permission from the commander on duty. So it wouldn't be their property, it would be ours. Regardless, it's theft to take the device with them once they remove it.

I think a better picture is just that the details of individual cases are mattering less and less.  People, especially communities of color, and *especially* working-class black communities, have been pissed for a looooong time about police.  With the mass protests and riots around Ferguson and subsequent acts of police violence creating a kind of rupture in the normal functioning of society, people's will for nuanced, case-by-case analysis fades away in favor of continuing the movement.  This, combined with the historic and growing lack of trust between cops and the community, make people even more inclined to not really care about the details of the case ('cops are just gonna lie about it anyway', etc).    newlinechar    newlinechar  Note that I'm not placing any moral judgement on anybody here; this probably just the way things are going to go.

Yeah, I've pushed my FreEagle to its limits. A internals all around, beam laser, dual multi-canon, KWS, A2 Shield Cell and FS Interdictor. It automatically shuts down the Priority 5 (Cargo Hatch) when retracted. When I deploy my hard points, Priority 3 and 4 go (Life Support, FSD, Interdictor). You can lessen your power draw by replacing some items with B or even D (which will lighten and increase jump range), but I tried putting a rail gun on that Eagle and even with D Life Support and Sensors, I lost everything but Priorities 1 and 2.

Well you mentioned having all the corrupted mods - ODA has nothing to do with corrupted mods, which is primarly done on ODE.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Are you making sure the game the system appropriately? You don't want to bring a full load out - just one strong weapon and a slow nova. The more level 30 weapons you bring, the higher level Lephantis becomes. You also obviously don't want to join pug groups because of how boss scaling functions.  newlinechar    newlinechar  And yes, its slower than Alad V, no one is saying its faster. The thing is though, Neurodes have a number of ways to get them. You want a few guaranteed ones, go run Lephantis. But you can slowly build your stockpile by doing other things as well. Go run ODS, try to get a nova part. Do an ODD, get a boltor reciever to sell. The reason people complain much less about neurodes is that you can collect Neurodes while completing other objectives in the game. While running Alad V is fairly painless and quick, the biggest frustration is that you have to go out of your way to do it. You don't simply get them by doing other objectives in the game, farming a neural sensor is a specific objective you have to slot time in for. But lets say you want T3 keys, the best place is on earth, which also drops neurodes. It drops from 2 missions that drop prime parts. There are multiple methods to get neurodes, so at least people feel like they have options, while with Neural Sensors all you have is alad V over and over and over and over again.

There's a very valid reason USB mass storage is no longer supported. In order to support that, phones had to split there internal storage in order to have a fat32 partition a computer could mount. This split was determined by the manufacturer, meaning you could easily have run our of room for apps but have plenty for other storage uses, or vice versa. By using MTP, newer versions of Android allow the internal storage to be used by the phone for whatever you need, and still let the storage be read by a computer. In my opinion this is a much better option. As for everything else you mentioned, I agree.

Interesting then, that the Soviets never paid them for it. No, this was a stupid move aimed at 'improving relations with the Soviets'  newlinechar    newlinechar  Keen to thaw Anglo-Soviet relations, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee invited Soviet scientists and engineers to the Rolls-Royce jet facility to learn how the superior British engines were made. Attlee further offered to license production to the USSR—after exacting a solemn promise that the engines would be utilized only for non-military purposes. The offer stunned the Americans, who protested loudly. And the Soviets? Russian aviation historian and Ukrainian native Ilya Grinberg says, “Stalin himself couldn’t believe it. He said, ‘Who in their right mind would sell anything like this to us?’ ” Grinberg, a professor of technology at the State University of New York at Buffalo, points out that the presence in the delegation of Artem Mikoyan himself—the “Mi” in MiG—should have been a tip-off to what in fact ensued: The Rolls-Royce samples shipped to the USSR in 1946 were promptly installed into MiG-15 prototypes and successfully flight-tested. By the time the fighter was ready for mass production, the Soviets had reverse-engineered the Nene; their copy was designated the Klimov RD-45. When the British objected to the violation of their licensing agreement, says Grinberg, “the Russians just told them ‘Look, we incorporated a few changes. Now it qualifies as our own original design.’ ”  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  Read more: http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-jet-that-shocked-the-west-180947758/#CmObSEBQ0v0cDJUP.99  newlinechar  Save 47% when you subscribe to Air &amp; Space magazine http://bit.ly/NaSX4X  newlinechar  Follow us: @AirSpaceMag on Twitter  newlinechar    newlinechar  From the very beginning the design was a sequence of compromises.

I would not interpret 'at the quantum level' to refer to the schmorgesborg of unproven and untestable quantum gravity theories, but simply to either regular old, 1920s, wavefunctions and observables QM or 1960s Feynmann diagrams and second quantization QFT.  The kind of stuff that people talk about when they talk about the 'quantum world'.

I wish /r/secondaryinfertility was more active as well. I mostly lurk here as I do have one child but the advice and support I read here has been invaluable.

Even the RE seemed surprised that we were able to conceive our first 'without even clomid' ... But here we are. Maybe he was just a fluke. Had I known, we would have started TTC earlier after #1.

Has it ever occurred to you that what you considered 'immature pouting' was an adult effort not to ruin Christmas by being openly angry (as he had every right to be) at you (a) disrespecting him and (b) twisting the 'spirit' of Christmas to do so, akin to emotional blackmail?

In retrospect, I'm sure by that age they have to have seen their father angry about something. Yet they didn't say he was angry, they said he pouted or had a 'low-key temper tantrum'.

Thing is, you can say the exact opposite for abortion. If women don't want kids so badly but want to sleep with the whole town, they should get their tubes tied by your logic.

Why should men be forced to waive their reproductive rights for life just to not have to deal with children? They shouldn't is the answer to that question.

Yeah. The frequency of posts here is so slow. If you're just waiting for new videos of people dying you're gonna have a bad time. Reposts keep the sub active and give us something to talk about, plus there are plenty of people who haven't seen the video. We don't want to be like /r/justiceporn where there is like one post every other day sometimes.

Yeah but home games it doesnt matter as much cause Chelsea ESPECIALLY expects to win those, they get screwed where it matters in the away games. I'd rather have the even spread if it means less cards in away games. Think about it.
That would be rather odd considering that there is no history of anarchism in ancient Greece.

If you think the answer to queer suicide is to call bullies murderers then I feel that your energy could be better directed.  That's really all I want to say.  Saying that the teens have no choice (i.e., saying bullying is homicide and that the suicide was not a choice) removes their agency.    newlinechar    newlinechar  It's possible for someone to believe that bullying is bad, that queer teens are bullied and sometimes commit suicide because of it, and also believe that it's a choice that the bullied teens make and that bullying =/= murder.    newlinechar    newlinechar  That doesn't mean that I don't care about queer teens.

It's my understanding from my wife that clinical areas are almost exclusively nurse only. Because the hospital in House had a free clinic, it would seem that as a courtesy they may put doctors or possibly new resident (new doctors  fresh out of med school) there for learning purposes. I think in House's case, his clinic duty was a punishment due to his bad attitude, which is possible but probably really rare.

I do know what you mean. There isn't a term. In all truth, despite the tempting possibility of examining the economic structure and patriarchy separately, you can't. Instead, it's worthwhile and actually rhetorically essential to incorporate a gendered analysis of capital into your understanding.

The goal in each 'leg' of darts is to score 501 points exactly (and you must finish with a double or the bull).  The two players take turns to throw 3 shots each, and the winner is the person who gets there first (giving an advantage to the player who throws first, and thus this is rotated, similar to server advantage in tennis).  newlinechar    newlinechar  This video is of a '9 dart finish'. This is famed because 9 darts is the absolute minimum that you can score 501 with.  There are a few different ways to get there, but typically this means throwing 180 with your first 3 darts (3 treble 20s), 180 with your second 3 darts, and then 141 as I described above.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Does that answer your question, or have I misunderstood you?

Only issue I have with your post is your thoughts on her range. Spell and basic attack ranges are measured differently for some strange reason. Spells are measured from the centre of the caster to the centre of the target, while basic attacks are measured from the edge of the attacker to the edge of the victim. This means that basic attacks are about 100 units longer than spells. Cass' range is closer to Ashe's, but not longer than Cait's. The rest is pretty spot-on.
