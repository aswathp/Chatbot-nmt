Dave Reisner initially packages systemd for archlinux and back in the early days it was a lot of work to run. You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while.  newlinechar    newlinechar  What happened was two-fold:  newlinechar    newlinechar  1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc.  newlinechar    newlinechar  2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.

The lightning proc from mjollnir is a lot stronger than maelstrom, it also has the lightning shield. The attack speed isn't necessarily wasted because you can only have max attack speed on one person every 15 seconds even with agh's. I don't think that it's categorically bad to get mjollnir on Windrunner even though I personally just get maelstrom then go for agh's, daedalus and MKB. If I was against a PL who was getting strong I would definitely upgrade the maelstrom rather than selling it so that I can clear his illusions.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell. 
I don't want anything serious though. As long as you promise 0 emotional attachment.

The difficulty for me is knowing where the proper balance is, you know?  Like, I feel immodest and like I'm trying to draw attention to myself, in most women's clothing.  Anything that has any sort of curves I feel like I'm drawing attention to my chest.  newlinechar    newlinechar  And I grew up with what I now realize are pretty extreme modesty rules.  And I know we're not expected to dress like that, but it still means that if I'm not following those rules, or if I want to wear something because it looks nice, it feels like I'm drawing attention to myself.  I only feel modest in clothing that makes me look like a little girl.

I never said it was bad. I'm sure for some people it is a fine CPU, but for gamers, choosing a CPU with only two threads isn't a good decision as it limits your selection of games and there is good reason to believe that the need for at least four threads for games is only going to become more common.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I just don't get why the Pentium G3258 has become a meta in this subreddit.

All Jews ignore certain parts of the Torah. The Torah has the death penalty for like every other thing. There are also an enormous number of supporting documents created by important cultural figures and theologians throughout the millennia. Different communities read different texts, interpret different things differently, or simply ignore other things. My suspicion having met many Jews, Christians,  and Muslims in my life is that the moderates don't even read their core texts. Extremists not only read core texts and supporting documents, but they also take traditions in their communities very seriously. Sexual segregation in ultra orthodox communities and face coverings in ultra conservative Muslim communities are examples of traditions, not so much specifically religiously mandated acts.

Maybe he's decided he doesn't give a fuck.

Right, which I think is really useful to know. But what I've seen happen is people read this and then forget what the cold hard reality is, you are dealing with another human being who hears these kinds of lines all day long, the safest thing you can do is be extremely polite, friendly, and cooperate until you're asked to do something that you're not comfortable with.  newlinechar    newlinechar  For example, I'm going to roll my window all the way down, I'll keep my hands in plain sight. I'm happy to provide my ID, and insurance, blah, blah, blah. If he asks me to step out of my car so he can search it, then the answers is a definite no unless he has a good reason. But hopefully it never gets to that point.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I have quite a few friends who are cops. Good cops. But they get extremely irritated and some of the 'tips' in here and they've told me straight up that they will 'find' a reason to hold you longer for being an ass. Illegal? Maybe. But I'd rather err on the side of being proactively helpful until it becomes a more serious issue. 
I think Judaism and Islam are far more similar than Christianity. Christianity took a big old 'left turn' when Paul took it to the Gentiles and its message became Hellenized (mixed with Greek/Roman 'stuff). That 'Trinity' bullshit isn't in Islam nor is Jesus though of as anything more than a prophet. But from what I've read you're absolutely right that early Christianity was around and had an impact on the formation of Islam.

Well, the 970 would only be able to support a single 4k monitor at 60 Hz.  There are no monitors that currently support HDMI 2.0, which is required for 60 Hz.  With the 970, you'd be limited to 30 Hz on the second screen via HDMI 1.4b.  newlinechar    newlinechar  There are some tricky monitors that can take multiple HDMI inputs and combine their signals to create a 60 Hz 4k signal, but both the video card and the monitor need to be on board with that kind of functionality.

&gt; Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer.

Wtf?  newlinechar    newlinechar  This annoys me all the damn time, even prior to this patch.

Yeah like, it was seriously terrifying.  I spent half that night wondering if she was going to continue on and have some sort of psychotic break and physically harm me or something.

My assumption about Ward only goes as far as how I think the season will end. I believe it's very realistic that some time in the future Ward may be contacted by either Skye or Coulson to help with a supernatural threat, i.e. the Inhumans. Otherwise why build up such an interesting back story for Ward, one where Ward seeks justice for his brother and punishment for horrible mother and father and older brother, and only have Ward as a villain in the end.  newlinechar    newlinechar  In the end, I agree with you. They have to utilize Ward for something, and it will involve Skye in some form or another.

Hm alright then. I'll change my comment to 'near-omnipotent beings' then. The only reason I used the term 'omnipotent' is because that's the term that's repeatedly used in the classic Dr. Strange comics I'm reading, to describe beings like Dormammu, Shuma-Gorath and Mephisto and etc (and only when they are inside their own realms are they considered omnipotent). But I guess that's just an exaggeration then.

I totally get what you mean in terms of being cautious. There were a few times where I noticed that he put himself in between myself and others until we passed them. For example, we were walking through a parking lot back home (back in our old apartment in Queens), and there were about 5-6 guys standing in the middle talking with each other. He's on an extender leash so he was ahead of me, but I noticed him notice them ahead of us, slowed down until he was in between them and myself, and then when we passed them completely he sped up again. He didn't lunge or bark or do anything differently other than that though, it's only because I'm always paying attention to everything he does that I noticed it. Too bad he doesn't know what officer's uniforms look like, but again - I don't mind him being protective of me. :)

Installing and uninstalling the VaultHunter.exe protocols, according to Claptrap's origin ECHOs, also screws with Claptrap's memory, so it's possible Clappy doesn't remember even being the Fragtrap. Her whole purpose in interrogating Athena is to see if she feels sorry for what she did. Instead, Athena makes no apologies for the role she played, and that understandably pisses Lilith off. Had she run Claptrap through that same line of questioning, it's unclear if he even would have remembered, so it would've been little more than an exercise in futility.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Unlike Claptrap and Angel, Athena had the option to walk away at any time.

That's an interesting point. Clearly the economic dimension is huge. And if you take France, Gaullism in the 1960's had a definite ethnic tinge. The best way I can think of is to track the differences about Algeria: in the 1960's it was about hanging on to French Algeria, with the National Front it is all about how Algeria was also the good fight (Le Pen senior was a paratrooper).   newlinechar    newlinechar  The thing is that a.) the National Front is now distancing itself from that position and b.) Gaullism was also in some vague contradictory sense anti-Fascist, or at least based on the mythology of the French resistance: but that's becoming weaker as well.   newlinechar    newlinechar  So there's definitely a continuity of sentiments but the direction and motivation is changing.

It's funny, Chinese manufacturing operations have picked up on the fact that there's big money in unique and well made metal work.

Who hasn't killed an Avatar?  newlinechar  
&gt; Sure they do.  newlinechar    newlinechar  No they aren't. Not even light works the same way.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.   newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly.  newlinechar    newlinechar  What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.

Right. But if the marbles instead go down in value, say to 50 cents for 100 marbles, you've lost 50% of your cash value. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, it may be significantly more valuable or significantly less valuable or exactly as valuable compared to when you bought it. The reason for this is as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows speculators are trying to guess how much each bitcoin is worth and going to be worth, and those guesses change dramatically each week.
I don't think it was necessarily that Terry Pegula wanted to bring in his own people but that most people in Buffalo, including Pegula, weren't sold on Marrone yet.

I don't think he was the long term answer for us.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Also, this gives us a chance to interview Frank Reich and see if he's worth giving a shot before someone else snatches him up.

Ehhhh. A little bit of the manifesto and what other commies have rehashed to me. It has helped with understanding economics a little better, but that just made me lean towards syndicalism. Sure capitalism allows for people to get lucky and never have to do anything productive for the rest of their lives, but socialism has this miserable taboo that is so embedded in some cultures we may as well give up trying to preach it. Syndicates have been shown to work the most effectively for the most people in real life. But there's still thus competitive atmosphere that I see is necessary, but it's not exactly morally fulfilling. I think it's more a problem with people thah politics.

Sorry, I didn't see anything about actually using the skills to learn in your original post so I assumed you were talking about just reading material.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Perhaps it would help if you described the concepts you are having trouble with? People in this subreddit seem pretty willing to help! I'm sure you aren't too stupid, Haskell is just radically different from imperative languages.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up.  newlinechar

I'm not a structural engineer, so I can't give you generalisable answers. You can see before the reno the load bearing beam was below the joists in the opening that existed between these two rooms - probably because it was cheaper and easier to install in this configuration.   newlinechar    newlinechar  No, you sacrifice no strength - the joist span is identical in both cases.

The height of the beam is what gives it its strength. There may not be space between stories to install an appropriate beam for the span. Using a steal I-beam can often work.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.   newlinechar    newlinechar  The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.   newlinechar    newlinechar  They didn't choose anything. Societies don't make two or three-way choices at pivotal moments. History isn't actually like EU4 or something.

You can't excuse everything with 'Magic is complicated.'  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  Sure, ok, they are fixing it, I guess, with 3 hours of downtime which will just piss everyone off anyway.  newlinechar    newlinechar  It seems to me like they could have just had a notice to set your clock back if you want to play until it works out and fix it on scheduled downtime. I could be wrong though.

Yeah, you're probably going to play against Chronos or Merc with those bans.  I see Vamana sometime.

I really doubt that, and that would be a longshot based on his  shallow understanding of Anna.

'Now it’s clear that hyperglycemia (HG) alone or combined with hypercholesterolemia has synergistic toxic effects on the survival and function of stem cells' - Why is this important? Because stem cells are established to be reparative to vessels, which prevents arteriosclerosis (Yes, you know this - the one that causes CHD, IHD, sudden heart attacks, decreased blood flow, etc.).  newlinechar    newlinechar  But what if it is the hypercholesterolemia that causes the toxic effects on stem cells? 'Increased dietary carbohydrates, particularly simple sugars and starches with high glycemic index, can increase levels of small, dense LDL and HDL'. Even then, carbohydrates increase the rates of LDL, which we all know as a major factor in the production of cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis.  newlinechar    newlinechar  There is no surprise that a diet low in simple sugars (besides fructose) and meat has been proven to be most healthy. That is the way our body has developed for tens of thousands of years of evolution.   newlinechar    newlinechar  In order for a study to be done on low-carb diets accurately, it must either measure the effects of a diet where most of the protein comes from vegetable sources, or one where most come from animal sources. In this study, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506174), 'reductions in LDL-C concentration and total cholesterol-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B-apolipoprotein AI ratios were greater for the low-carbohydrate compared with the high-carbohydrate diet'. In this case, the low-carb diet got its protein from vegetable sources, a diet recognized to be very natural for our body. Most of the hate from 'clean' diets comes from the fact that not all low-carb diets actually do what they claim. We know that 'Low-carbohydrate, high-animal protein diets, which are advocated for weight loss, may not promote the desired reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration', but that is just indicative of the well-known fact that animal protein is not very healthy for us, most significantly when consume in excess.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Bottom line - eating healthy means eating less (something I didn't touch on, but is very important), and and eating a low-carb diet that is low on meat. These types of diets have been shown to decrease chances of diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer to diabetes. But let's face it - bodybuilders right now are concerned with IIFYM, not longeivity :)  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475066/  newlinechar  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16256003

I hope they come up with something to answer this bit..

Basically it was an intergenerational debate (happens once a year) on e-democracy vs traditional representative democracy (that year). Mix of schools, unis and a uni for the elderly (uni of the third age). I won the debate in my school so me and another girl from my AS politics class were able to go.

My husband decided to become a reverend, and as a result is going to school full time. Combine that with a poor-ish childhood and you create a person like me: frugal and concerned with saving money.   newlinechar    newlinechar  There were some extremely lean years, and I started working at 15. I have put myself in situations that were less than safe due to lack of funds and no choice (buses and CTA through bad neighborhoods, broken down car in bad areas, putting up with sexual harassment at work because I needed the money, etc) and after having a kid, I realized I never wanted her in those situations.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I get my inspiration from Mormon housewife blogs and Pinterest, mostly. I know Mormons are not well-liked on the internet, but those ladies have to present themselves In a certain way, have a bunch of kids (typically), can't really work outside the home, and need to make a dollar stretch. They give some darn good tips. (I should add that we are not Mormon, but still, the money saving tips are great!)   newlinechar    newlinechar  I remind myself that any dollar I don't need to spend is a dollar my kid doesn't need to earn later in life. That stops me from spending money I don't need to spend.   newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  We are in the process of moving now, from a really expensive extremely rich neighborhood, to a middle class one. We will be selling our condo, and for half the price, buying a two bedroom home. I make a good living, but at work, I'm the person who is always willing to help,  always willing to go the extra mile, and as a result, in a position to say 'I saved company $13m in 2013, can I have a 10% raise?' When you put it that way, and can verify it, they have a hard time saying no.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I work as a female in a male dominated industry (like 99.8% male) and therefore NO ONE NOTICES WHAT I WEAR. Hence the capsule wardrobe.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Another blog I read for inspiration is olgasflavorfactory.com. She has lessons from her immigrant parents on there. It's worth it's weight in gold.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Tl;dr:  a poor childhood stays with you forever. 
Even putting aside this point, it's perfectly legal to show **pretty much anything in a movie**, since it's something that a studio can decide to release or not release, a theater can choose to exhibit or not exhibit, and a movie goer can decide to go see or not see.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Broadcast television is a limited public space (there is only so much broadcast bandwidth available), and so it was decided that broadcasts in this public space should be subject to public regulation (the Federal Communication Commission). That's why you can't show boobies on broadcast TV, that's why you can't say 'God cunt-fucking dammit' on broadcast TV and that's why you can't show someone's head exploding on broadcast TV.

I'm not sure I agree that there isn't proof.  You can see that the person is approaching the road.  You have testimony of the person whose car was damaged.  The damage to the car can be shown.  There may have even been a shoe print remaining or some similar physical evidence.  The sound indicates something hit the car.  The video shows the person is there and correlates his presence to the side of the damaged car and the sound.    newlinechar    newlinechar  The question is whether it's more likely the car was damage beforehand AND this person did not hit the car or (in my mind most likely) that the person did in fact damage the car as claimed.  If the officer followed up diligently there could potentially be evidence from that as well.  I would imagine if this went to a trial, there is a reasonable chance of winning.

That is a criticism I hear often. My response is the proximity to less than desirable areas is typical of many urban environments.

It is a square pizza similar to [Sicilian-style pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_pizza) that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust and toppings such as [pepperoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperoni) and olives, and is served with the marinara sauce on top.   The square shaped pizza is the result of being baked in a square pan, which is often not a pizza pan.  Rather, industrial parts trays are often used, which were originally made to hold small parts in factories.   newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;The crust of a Detroit-style pizza is noteworthy because in addition to occasionally being twice-baked, it is usually baked in a well-oiled pan to a chewy medium-well-done state that gives the bottom and edges of the crust a fried/crunchy texture.

The resulting pizza has a warm, chewy texture that, when combined with the sauce and toppings, is intensely flavorsome.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;====  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/tQMrGev.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Buddyssmallpizza.jpg)  newlinechar    newlinechar  ---  newlinechar    newlinechar  ^Interesting: [^Jet's ^Pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet%27s_Pizza) ^| [^Quad ^City-style ^pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_City-style_pizza) ^| [^Pizza ^cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_cutter) ^| [^Pizza ^pugliese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_pugliese)   newlinechar    newlinechar  ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnatbal) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnatbal)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

The numbers located along the green lines connecting the stars are an indication of distance in light years between them. The maximum distance the connections are displayed is 10.0 light years, which is a convention for hyperspace travel.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Since a vessel even with the best of calculations will drift due to gravitational forces, the usual maximum range for a safe hyperspace jump is 10 light years. After this point a vessel must return to normal space, recalibrate the hyperdrive, recharge the capacitors, and calculate a new course to continue to a farther destination. Remaining in hyperspace beyond the 10 light year limit can divert a vessel dangerously off course, in addition to the strain of hyperspace upon the drives resulting in malfunctions which render them inoperable. For this reason most hyperspace travel is conducted directly between star systems, using them as waypoints to reach farther targets while stopping to refuel and resupply. Fleets often arrive dispersed over several hundreds of kilometers from gravitational effects, as each ship jumps individually.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Thus the green lines of distance are also an indication of the routes that hyperdrive vessels take when travelling.

True, Morey would ship DMo out for Anderson no doubt just based on skill, Houston already has the defense so Anderson would be a perfect fit... but for the 8.5 mil he is making compared to DMo's 2.5, I don't know. If DMo expects to be paid after his contract is up next year though, I bet he does it. But if you can have DMo for half the price, I think you stick with that no? And you have to consider how DMo is part of the reason that defense is so solid.

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I last worked on the game about 3.5-4 years ago so I can't speak to what's been going on since, though I do know it is in pure maintenance mode - minimum staff, simply put out content and sustain itself.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Before that point, we on the team always wanted to put in game rune management in and it was being worked on at several points.  However, a lot of our resources were redirected into other projects such as some really ill-advised facebook games and integration with SOE's game launcher portal so it never completed, and the closing of our studio put an end to that.  The tutorial and new user experience was another area we were always trying to improve, but the will from management simply wasn't there to fund it after the first pass (the full game revamp of UI/simplification of mechanics done in 2009-2010 which included a new tutorial and new starter decks) failed to produce any improvements in our numbers.  Resolutions were a tricky spot - the initial engine for the game, as you might imagine for a game made in java by a mobile game company in the early 2000s, was not very easy to work with.  It was harder to fix than it looked according to our engineers, and there was never any real impetus from leadership to get it done.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Really the story of Poxnora is defined by the poor return on the marketing spend by SOE.  A lot of money was spent on advertising in really questionable places early on after the acquisition (such as sports and news websites), and after that failed the confidence of management in the game just slowly decayed away.  Generally developers are aware of the problems with their game (I was a hardcore player and addict of Poxnora for 2 years before I worked on it, and was always involved in the community) but unfortunately they don't always get to make the decisions.

To elaborate on this a little bit, natural movement is very complex. Eg. if you reach out to grab something you don't just tilt your shoulder and stretch your elbow, there is also some movement in the upper torso. And we are talking about some extremely simple action now.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Think about interacting actions (raise to the tips of your toes and stretch your arm to reach something), or worst of all facial expressions. And then those actions all have to fit together to produce an image that your brain wont instantly reject as robotic or fake (your brain is super good at that).  newlinechar    newlinechar  This takes a lot of experience and knowledge of anatomy to get at least semi-right if you do your animations by hand (which is why for most things, motion capture is prefered).

In theory, yes. In practice, not likely. To my knowledge of the different types of 3d printing I'm familiar with, none of them are able to utilize polymerization in the manufacturing.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Besides, there would still be a lot of unreacted monomer stuck in the polymer matrix. Typically with nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 you can 'wash' out the caprolactam with boiling water or water vapor or other polar solvents like methanol, but most of the moneymaking for polyamides are in hot melt processing, after the macromolecule has been formed and frozen solid.  newlinechar    newlinechar  That being said, if the poly being used reacts at a high temperature, you could in theory use a laser or set of lasers to raise the temperature in a small portion of a solution to polymerize and build from there. One form of additive manufacting does exactly this, only by melting bits of a bed of powdered metal.

I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;)  newlinechar    newlinechar  I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema.  newlinechar    newlinechar  But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises).  newlinechar    newlinechar  I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

What the Jews have done to piss off people in history  newlinechar    newlinechar  1) Be different  newlinechar    newlinechar  2) Continue to be different  newlinechar    newlinechar  The fact that they (or we, since I'm Jewish) have been persecuted across the globe for the better part of forever speaks more to intolerance for religious and ethnic diversity than some evil plot by the money grubbing Jews.   newlinechar    newlinechar  By the way, Hitler's complaint about the Jews involved them being parasites in Germany and thus keeping down the ethnically superior Aryan race (which was a horrible misinterpretation of anthropology itself). This mostly arose from the Jewish influence on Weimar Germany, which had become a center for liberalism in the arts since the fall of the German Empire. The only thing the Jews did wrong was paint and write novels that were risqué and not traditionally German in the way Hitler saw Germanic culture.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Also, Hitler going a 'little overkill.' You do realize that he systematically murdered 11 million people for no reason other than pure unadulterated racism, right? There is a big gap between accepting Jews and forcing them into ghettos like most of Europe had done. There is a canyon or two between ghettos and genocide.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Edit: I love this. Guy says Hitler had some legitimate reasons for hating Jews and only went a little overkill and is at +5.

TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.   newlinechar    newlinechar  There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

I could definitely use more coursework. I've taken applied linear algebra, applied linear regression and have worked my way through about half of Boyd's Convex Optimization book.

According to OP's original post:  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; My Ndad wasn't always an N. Growing up he was the best father anyone could ask for.   newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; My dads narcissism slowly emerged in the years following his accidents. It began with severe mood swings and paranoia, which eventually evolved into fantasies of self-importance and a desire for complete control of the entire family.  newlinechar    newlinechar  This is consistent with degenerative brain disease triggered by traumatic brain injury.  I really feel sorry for him AND his family.  He was doing his job and suffered traumatic brain injuries, and he was just left to disintegrate, destroying his own life and his family's lives.    newlinechar    newlinechar  Our legal system is a total mess when it comes to severe mental illness, insisting on treating obvious symptoms of mental illness beyond the person's control as 'exercising their freedom', and insisting that the law can't interfere with their 'rights' to 'freedom'.  And then after they kill or permanently maim one or more people (or dozens, as in the cases of Adam Lanza and Seung-Hui Cho), it seems like the whole country starts another round of wailing about how their needs to be more funding for mental health 'treatment', completely ignoring the fact that these people routinely refuse treatment, and the law doesn't allow them to be forced until *after* severe, irreparable harm has been done.

The difficulty with any Japanese names with an R is that you are either going to bastardize the pronunciation into an English hard-R or you are going to have an name no one can pronounce correctly. I'd recommend OP avoid Japanese names with R.
I disagree with none of that. Although honestly, I always thought the idea was spectacularly subjective anyway. Even if we did call it 'best QB', everyone has different ideas of what qualities are important or unimportant anyway. Thing is, sports people usually want to distill everything into a straight 1-2-3-4 progression of 'superiority' even if it doesn't really make sense in the apples compared to oranges world of the NFL.

I'm a huge CoD fan but I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy Black Ops 2 but loved the first. The way they have the series set up right now, I think Sledgehammer will be in charge of futuristic games or have an Advanced Warfare trilogy. Infinity Ward will have the Ghosts series and will be in charge of any present day games. And then Treyarch will be in charge of WW2, Vietnam War, Cold War ect. That's what would make the most sense to me. I can't see them releasing 3 modern shooters every year especially with Battlefield branching off into different styles of games with Hardline.

There's just too much uncertainty involved. You might be able to say that certain types of writing were *generally* to be taken literally, but that won't get you specifics when it comes to each passage. On top of that, each individual writer would bring his own set of beliefs. And even further, we aren't certain about what was changed and how accurate of a representation the current writing is compared to the original. It's also been translated. In many cases the story was an oral tradition for a while before it was written down.

Can confirm. Was at the premiere in Cannes. After the movie when we gave it a standing ovation, Schultz was in tears.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Edit: I just need to say, though, that I honestly think the homoeroticism is something that I think critics are reading way too much into. When I saw the movie, I never ever thought there was any homosexual nature in the relationship between du Pont and Schultz. I always got the creepy factor to be from the main theme of the film being how little the rich look at the poor. In fact, I think sexualizing their relationship REALLY undercuts that major point of the movie.

If it doesn't work for you I could just pop up the relevant mod files on Dropbox or something, let me know.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Along the same lines, I can mention a few more mods I like (not necessarily the names, but what they do):  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Cheaper Workboats - I really hate how prohibitively expensive workboats are for how finite they are compared to land workers that can stick around forever, and that mod makes them like ~90 gold or just a small amount of production, either being built in one turn in most cities or a few turns in a younger city.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * All Scouts get the Shoshone Ancient Ruin Bonus - I think that's an incredibly powerful bonus for allowing you to quickly get a free tech or go straight to no terrain penalty archers and composite bows (even potentially getting free techs in the late game if some ruins are still around), so I think it's fairer to make every civ's scout be able to do it. The barbarian encampment and map of surrounding area ruins are totally worthless IMO and this mod incentivizes always using scouts for ruins if you can to pick something better than that garbage. You can still pick up ruins with other units but lose the ability to choose, and I think that's an interesting strategic decision whether you always keep around scouts for that or just use your starting warrior or whatever.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Separate Great People Counters - This is probably a fairly well known mod but it means you don't have to min-max your great scientist and great engineer points anymore. You just get more great people over the course of the game, allowing you to use them in potentially interesting ways, and great merchants are no longer a pain in the ass but rather something you can plant or pop.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Fixed Great Prophets - Prophets spawn as soon as you hit the faith threshold pre-Industrial era instead of it being a random chance. I think the random chance is completely garbage game design and this mod fixes that. Highly recommended.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * All Siege Units Indirect Fire - I think it's very weird how only a fairly limited amount of siege units get indirect fire so this mod changes that. Makes some earlier siege units nicer when you can have a melee unit as a spotter or whatever rather than having to put the siege unit potentially in harm's way by being adjacent to a city with a melee garrison or something.  newlinechar    newlinechar  * Faster cultural border expansion - I think the Tradition opener is just too good for this, so it means non-Tradition AI has a chance at decent tile expansion, and Tradition empires will expand quite far to reduce holes in borders and stuff and just generally control more area even if they can't necessarily work it. Can also prevent you from having to use a great general to get a strategic resource just outside of the workable range, which is nice. The mod was actually still too slow for my taste so I reduced border expands to 1/3 the normal cultural cost, and I feel it works well, though of course with like EUI it will spam cultural border notifications eventually.  newlinechar

I always thought Perl had the right idea in terms of balancing convenience and avoiding surprises, in that the comparison operators drove the type coercion (`eq`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge` for string comparisons, `==`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` for numeric).  newlinechar    newlinechar  As the programmer, you're always in control of the comparison without hacks or having to remember a lot of complex/inconsistent/undocumented implicit conversion rules of the language.

&gt; Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place.  newlinechar    newlinechar  It's already ridiculous, but a 4th attempt would be completely over the top.  As for a spin off I'm somewhat confident it will happen as long as Disney allows it, cause the show's ratings got a huge boost from the Frozen arc.  If not a spin off maybe Anna and Elsa will return to the main show for another arc.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't have a link, but wasn't there an interview with Tyler Jacob Moore (Hans) earlier in the season talking about Hans' story picking up with his return to the Southern Isles after the events of the movie?  Since that didn't happen it's possible that he accidentally revealed something from the spin off instead of season 4A.  Maybe there's a spin off in the works set during the 2 years between Frozen and OUaT Season 4A.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I saw a lot of hate from the Once subreddit and certain podcasts, but I don't know.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Disney didn't do that, the books were never canonical.  The Force Unleashed games are canon, but other than that it's all a bunch of contradicting alternate universes.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt; I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't know, from what I've seen the Elsa and Anna series of books at least is basically just sisterly fluff set after the movie, nothing that's likely to be contradicted in Frozen 2 as long as they set it a couple years after the first movie or something like that.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I really just want more canon Frozen.  Like I know we're getting Frozen Fever and that's canon, but I would like for the books to be canon too.

Thing is, you can say the exact opposite for abortion. If women don't want kids so badly but want to sleep with the whole town, they should get their tubes tied by your logic. The reason that doesn't work is that a vasectomy (or tying tubes) is a *permanent* procedure. Why should men be forced to waive their reproductive rights for life just to not have to deal with children? They shouldn't is the answer to that question.

We can't exactly afford to upgrade all our rural roads to have shoulders and passing lanes.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The problem isn't so much the roads as the drivers. If people learned to flash their high beams to pass like the rest of the world does, and then the person in front pulls left slows down a bit to let them pass, we'd be fine.

In arcade they are basically a kill streak reward, you need to kill two enemies to get into a medium bomber/attacker, or three to get into a heavy bomber. The plane is randomly selected from a specific list, you do *not* bring your own planes to the fight.

Two other players from each team can join in fighters to defend or intercept you.  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  In RB you have a certain number of points available at the beginning of the match.

Interesting, thanks!
When you're talking about physical traits, I'm glad that I have a womanly voice, face and shape, sure. I'd feel a little miffed if someone told me I was manly in some physical way because being physically womanly pleases me. I like to look traditionally feminine with long hair and shaved legs and makeup and dresses; it's fun. I totally get why a guy who wants to look physically manly would be unhappy at being told he looked feminine in some fashion. Nothing sexist about wanting to look like a magnificent hunk of hot hot manliness/womanliness.   newlinechar    newlinechar  When you're talking about professions and capabilities, though, you're treading on far shakier ground because these things aren't just superficial; they have very real implications for how a person lives, and saying that, for example, having women enter STEM fields en masse makes some men uncomfortable cannot be easily solved by saying, 'Okay, ladies, back to the secretarial pool with you.' That genie is out of the bottle, and she's working in your lab or studio or boardroom.   newlinechar    newlinechar  When you describe wanting to keep women out of male-centric parts of life, the unfortunate side effect is keeping women *down*. I'm not saying that's what you intend; I don't believe you do, and I appreciate your having a real discussion about something I'm seeing in a new light. That's the net effect, though, of suggesting men must have somewhere away from women to retreat to retain their manliness.   newlinechar    newlinechar  While women have visibly moved into areas that used to be exclusively male, men have quietly moved into areas that used to be overwhelmingly female domains. Nurses, teachers, stay-at-home parents -- guys can do these things now, and as far as I know, there hasn't been a huge backlash from women claiming it makes them feel unfeminine to have male nurses and nannies. No one has said, 'Now that men take an unabashed delight in caring for their children, how can I still feel feminine?'   newlinechar    newlinechar  That's what I'm getting at: There's still a presumption there, unconscious though it may be, that femininity is less than masculinity, that women therefore lower the intrinsic value of something by making it less masculine when they participate in 'traditional men things.' You wonder 'If anyone can do it, how is it masculine,' but I don't know that any woman thinks that way about femininity. I don't think I'm less feminine if you, a man, do something I traditionally do. I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult.   newlinechar    newlinechar  By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's *abso-fucking-lutely* meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries. These things aren't said to girls and women as an accurate and neutral assessment of their skills; they're said to boys and men to demean them because in the speaker's mind, being compared to a girl is *a very bad thing*.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I want to live in a world in which doing things 'like a girl' is not automatically considered less good than doing things 'like a boy.' When that happens, maybe we'll stop worrying about whether having a woman as a company's CEO somehow takes away from men's masculinity.  newlinechar    newlinechar

The key is double trapping each beast. With 3 friends they all double trap the same beast. They are getting 6 crates per beast. Lets say they stockpile and want 100 crates on each character to last them 3 weeks. Thats going to take them 50 beasts. Since double trapping is OP, and they have 3 people they can knock out 50 beasts in under a hour. Do that on 6-7 characters each over the course of a week. Now you have no need to go trapping for 3 weeks. Now you can relax and  gain 0-100 bloods a day while watching people say there is a savaging blood dupe going on, when really WoW just has too many people with alts all with level 3 barn.   newlinechar    newlinechar  (note reason why you gain 0-100 is because each work order has a chance to give a blood.

Which is why I said 'Most likely' ;) There's always a few exceptions. 
Here is my intuition based judgements on the Red Bull trio based on their junior career, watching them drive, their adaptability.  newlinechar    newlinechar  1) Vettel is very good. He is up there with drivers like Button, Bottas, Hulkenberg. He is a strong driver who given a dominant car will win consistently.  newlinechar    newlinechar  2) Vergne is more or less on a similar level to that, he is a weaker qualifier than Vettel but a stronger racer.   newlinechar    newlinechar  3) Ricciardo is a step above those two, but not quite in the league of Alonso-Hamilton. He skirts around about below those top two and there is no driver really on 'his level', just drivers below and above.  newlinechar    newlinechar  To me when you look at their performances around their entire career, against the team mates they've faced and just watching how they drive that is the likely option. I fail to believe that Vettel is just average and Ricciardo is above average, but nor do I think they're the two best drivers on the grid. I suspect they're towards the front, but not at the very top.  newlinechar    newlinechar  But now that Vettel has left the Red Bull family and gone to Ferrari, especially with Raikkonen looking ready to retire in coming seasons its very likely we will see him against a range of team mates, maybe Bottas or Hulkenberg. Maybe a driver we haven't even heard of yet.

The R210 II is extremely quiet, especially for a 1U server. The switch is considerably louder.   newlinechar    newlinechar  That said, start loading up the CPU and it can get very loud, but it does a great job at modulating the fans. The previous gen, the R210 on the other hand was pretty bad at modulating the fans and even with the latest BMC update was pretty noisy all the time.

Yep, I see that as one of the cost of big budget games, or rather where every cent spent must be justified when they're not cheap to make.   newlinechar    newlinechar  The weird thing is that Thief was a long project, announced earlier than DE:HR. There were rumors before release that it was a troubled project, so I imagine the project was reset a few times, and time on the final version wasn't enough to spend on the world. It's weird, because 'the world' should be a strength of the immersive sim type game that is part of Thief, and they should have known this as it was developed at the same studio that made DE:HR.
The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.  
i was pretty happy finding mine for $40 so I thought it was a great purchase

So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving.

Once the vehicle is immobilized, it becomes the property of the police department in the sense that the driver is not permitted to move it without paying their outstanding fines or, for unusual cases, receiving permission from the commander on duty. So it wouldn't be their property, it would be ours. Regardless, it's theft to take the device with them once they remove it. I suppose that leaves them with either taking the device with them (theft) or destroying it and leaving it behind (destruction of property), so either way they're left with charges of some sort.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I would be curious, however, to see a case where someone manages to pick the lock and leave the device. Can't charge them with theft, can't charge them with destruction of property. Sounds like a win for them, in my book.

Dated to me means of its time, and to me the CGI, occasionally ho-hum action, and by-the-numbers origin story structure dates it to that era. I'm not denying that at the time it was revolutionary, in the same way Star Wars was back in '77. But while Star Wars has dated in its own way as well, I think it holds up in ways that Spider-Man doesn't; the basic story structure of Star Wars is the timeless Hero's Journey myth, to me the script for the '02 Spider-Man has that early noughties restricted origin story structure (which as you said is still leaps and bounds above what came before). Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight are rid of those story shackles and shoehorned-in awkward CGI, and also are more daring in their cinematography (Pfister specifically says that in a quote for TDK), and as such are more timeless to me. They could both be replaced today and I'd believe they were shot in the past year.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I was so desperate to see a Marvel movie as a kid I nearly rented that Hasselhoff Fury from the video store. I begged my dad to take me to see Blade when it came out and had to leave during the opening scene as it was 2scary4me (saw Small Soldiers instead, good movie).

Your daughter has a hell of a mother, I fully believe if you've gotten this far you've got the momentum to keep it up.

&gt;You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era.  newlinechar    newlinechar  First, there is plenty of material wealth in the russian west, and second,  russian siberian wealth was, if anything more easily exploitable than Alaskan wealth, which the US managed to get at pretty well.  Why?  because the US had a policy, at least up until the 1920s, of giving away land to anyone who was willing to use it for some productive end.  Russia had just about the opposite policy, formally binding serfs to the land until the 1860s, and only eliminating the last vestiges of those restrictions in the early 20th century.  The railroads in russia were not built by russian Leland Stanfordoviches, but by the ministry of rail, so it is hardly suprising that the US built more rail miles by 1860 than the russians had by 1905.  Again, choices were made, and choices have consequences.    newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it  newlinechar    newlinechar  Siberia, and russia, is a massive fucking place, it isn't all snow and caribou.  I've been there, and it's perfectly habitable.  And if you had offered to give it to whatever peasant got there first, it would have been settled.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade.    newlinechar    newlinechar  trade in china even after the opium wars was very extremely restricted by the imperial government, as it had been for centuries, with monopolies on many important goods, imperial manipulation of grain prices, and limits on merchants borne out of confucian dislike of commerce.  newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  Isn't it funny how 400 million chinese couldn't resist british imperialism, but a few million americans could?  Again, it's almost like some societies are more successful than others!  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar    newlinechar  or more proof that brazil makes poor choices.  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues,   newlinechar    newlinechar  good thing the US [never had any of those.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War)  But, of course, you miss the point.  those weird internal issues are not random outliers, they are not noise.  they come about as a result of decisions societies make.  Not, as you rightly point out, in a conscious manner, but choices are still made.  Russian czars chose not to give away eastern land, the US chose to give away western.

I haven't noticed that, and I think the difference is that there's still an underlying level of socialization that suggests femininity is less than masculinity.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Women aren't afraid of losing their femininity as men move into spaces that used to be exclusively feminine because we aren't socialized to believe masculinity is lower than femininity. On the contrary -- men can readily move into those spaces and be praised for it. It's kind of how women can dress in masculine or tomboyish clothes and be thought cute, but men who dress in feminine clothes are generally mocked or reviled. It's because women are seen as taking a step up; men are subconsciously seen as taking a step down.   newlinechar    newlinechar

&gt;which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately  newlinechar    newlinechar  That's from a misunderstanding of what an honour or knighthood is, and for what they're given out.  newlinechar    newlinechar  People such as Elton John aren't given it just for inspiring work, but usually for other aspects in what they do in their position, like charity work, or making a major difference in the lives of the people (and not just by being inspirational).   newlinechar    newlinechar  In fact, that's what Elton John was given a knighthood for - for his charitable services. Not his music. And it's what Bill Gates received a knighthood for (however as a foreigner and American, he's not allowed to use 'sir' (American being the US law doesn't recognise nor allow these type of things, and that non-commonwealthers aren't permitted to use these titles).  newlinechar    newlinechar  ---  newlinechar  In reality, the monarch does not have any personal involvement in deciding who receives an honour or who is knighted. The people nominated, by anyone, goes through a committee, and then the Prime Minister 'advises' (tells the monarch) who she is going to honour or knight.  newlinechar    newlinechar  So the personal involvement that's necessary for a monarch to 'disagree' when another is crowned isn't present. It's not convention and will not be done anyway.  newlinechar    newlinechar  People who receive honours or knighthoods can refuse them themselves, or have them removed if they commit a crime. More likely if the crime was related to the reason for which they received the honour or knighthood.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If people are sentenced to prison for at least three months, or something like a doctor being struck off for malpractice, or any other reason, these cases go to the Honours Forfeiture Committee who then recommend to the monarch via the Prime Minister whether it should be removed or not.  newlinechar    newlinechar  As to whether the monarch in this instance personally decides or not, or whether she will still act on the advice of the PM as is convention, I'm not sure. It's entirely possible for her to decide, and that's what is formally said of this system. The Queen decides who gets awarded them etc.  newlinechar    newlinechar  One recent UK example of controversy is [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), who people think should have his knighthood stripped because of the paedophilia claims. Well, I think it's still claims. Not sure. It came to light once he died.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I'm afraid I can't think of any examples of it being forfeited after a crime, but it's gone 1am, I've been drinking, and it's now New Year's Day.

I've said this before on reddit, but I just don't think abortion is the solution. It's a symptom of a broken system. Poor sex education and poor access to contraceptives cause teen pregnancy, which is still extremely taboo. Fear of judgement and being ostracized prevents young girls from seeking out wise counsel and being able to consider all the options. I feel like our current culture not only could do better in preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it also drives people to what is, in my opinion, an extreme measure (abortion).   newlinechar    newlinechar  I don't think anyone LIKES abortion. No one is out in the streets saying 'abortion is great!' No one wants to kill a fetus, that's why it's such a tough decision to make. I think most of us can agree that unwanted pregnancy is the ultimate, but fixable, problem to tackle here.
I didn't feel a foot!
I don't see electoralism as the way to fundamentally change the economic system. Modern political structures were built in service of the capital-owning class, and even a socialist government elected by majority would face severe governmental hurdles and plenty of opportunities for reaction. I think the role of socialist electoralism is to build a movement and for campaigns to serve as early platforms for the labor organizing and community mobilization that will eventually make the economic revolution.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I doubt Bernie Sanders will win the presidency in 2016. Massive surges by new parties have happened before, but I think it would require a bigger departure from established rhetoric than this 12-point plan. That's just to be the kind of paradigm-breaking movement that can inspire such a surge. It still won't happen if voters are too apathetic or too hostile to socialism.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If Sanders runs in a socialist party with genuinely socialist rhetoric, I'll support him. I don't think he'd win the presidency, but I don't think that should be the goal. The national campaign should be a platform for local elections, in which socialists could actually take control of city governments in presently Democrat-dominated districts. For example, Milwaukee has 38 years of history of socialist government and a mayoral election in 2016. Taking it back for socialists would be a big step for once again proving that socialist governance can get results. Combined with increased labor organizing and readying ourselves to fight reaction, we can actually advance the movement.

It's generally considered a large gap ($26 extra in fees per 10k invested), but given that the industry average is ~1%, .46% is a pretty decent deal.

Cersei is not a *true* player of the game, like OP asked for. She is somebody that thinks she is a real player, but is in fact a terrible excuse for one. Everything she has is because of somebody else's actions. Her arrogance and sheer stupidity are playing into the hands of the real players right now in fact. She is just a pawn.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I find it hilarious that she was the first character to reference the Game of Thrones, leading us to believe she was the pinnacle of schemers.

Yeah it's one of those situations where the interviewer embarrassed herself (here, in the interview, on twitter), the interviewee embarrassed himself (in the interview, on facebook), the website got traffic but humiliated itself in the public eye - especially in regards to the professional slander they basically gave a podium to.  newlinechar    newlinechar  There are some interesting takeaways (the necklace, the new timeline, the confessed perjury), but I am gobsmacked as to what the real intent in this interview was for all parties.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I would say that this was thoughtlessly constructed, but then I remember reading Glen's responses.

I'm not completely serious, a blanket fix like that would cause more problems than it creates. but overall guardians have the more balanced of the scalings and whatnot that I'd actually like to see on most other classes, then guardians can be mostly 'redefined' to be much more utility based than so much damage.  It just seems if you're not doing damage you're literally not doing anything right now, and utility needs to be a larger factor in the game.

Well said, but at the same time not a reason to give up trying.
See for me this year was always supposed to be about The Witcher 3. The Witcher 2 for me is imo the best rpg since the year 2000.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I'll be honest, I've not played Inquisition, I was not a fan of Dragon Age 1 or 2.

I don't mean to piss in your cheerios. We're all scratching our heads how to rebalance things. Because of the recent changes to the demo's pipes and loch'n'load I find myself spamming from medium to long ranges these days...and ultimately accomplishing nothing.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Choke points used to be awesome as you had opportunities to ambush people. Now you just get spammed out. The extra pipe for the loch gives the demo another opportunity to miss while dealing out massive damage.   newlinechar    newlinechar  If you took one random rocket for 60 damage coming up to the corner. It'll only take 2 loch'n'load pills to kill you. Sure the demo's aim has to be solid, but if you're spinning and shooting your minigun, your movement is reduced and there's no way to keep up with the damage that even a mediocre demo outputs.   newlinechar    newlinechar  To put it in simplest terms: Operating at 240 HP as a heavy is a disadvantage with his current minigun nerf.

I don't think anyone really likes abortion. There's no such thing, at least that I've come across, as a pro-abortion advocate. They are pro-choice advocates, and support a woman's right to choose to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
I've been struggling with vulnerability for a few months now, partly thanks to my readings on gender and gender expectations. One interesting book I've found on the subject is [Daring greatly](http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592407331/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420073917&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brene+brown+daring+greatly) by the wonderful Brene Brown. She has done a lot of research on shame and the trauma it causes, and the one thing she has found to work best against shame is vulnerability itself. She describes ways we can strive to be shame-resilient and to be vulnerable even as people ridicule us for it. If we want to make a change for men, I believe we will need to do it ourselves. For our own sake. In any case, I don't feel comfortable waiting on others to fix my life for me -- it may be a gender expectation of males, but I want to  feel empowered and in control. Women will change, but I'm not waiting.

The fastest way to complete a set is to bank your honor points while collecting random pvp rewards from Battlegrounds, Ashran, and Gladiator sanctum. Only buy items to fill gaps- this will reduce the number of duplicate items you end up with.  newlinechar    newlinechar  - Side objectives in Ashran award a ton of random items, honor, conquest points, and give you bones...  newlinechar    newlinechar  - Buy a gladiator's sanctum, and level it up ASAP.

I'd love to see more content but I'd doubt that it'll be from 4LS because of its 4chan-monkeys-with-typewriters origin. That hasn't stopped its members from writing individually though, as we've seen with the recent [Miki path script](http://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/comments/2qb7pm/did_someone_say_miki_path/). Who knows, maybe some the main writers will or even have already moved on to new projects. The great news for us is that even if 4LS never reappears with another game, it seems likely that they'll be spiritual successors. One that I know to look out for is [Missing Stars](https://www.reddit.com/r/missingstars), which seems to be shaping up nicely and is even being supported by Mike Inel who'll create animations for it. Needless to say, I haven't given up hope :)

I am amazed that this seems to be so poorly followed. I live in the UK and guns are pretty much non existent for most of the population. My dad taught me to shoot when I was younger and even though the only guns I ever owned were .22 air pistols or rifles it was the first thing he taught me and he also made sure it was enforced. I always assumed that in the states this would be like knowing the national anthem. Of course we usually only hear about these things when they are not following the rule. You never hear about the 1000,s of times people practice good gun safety.

Generally I turn down the extremely weird ones or totally unreasonable ones, just because they usually aren't paying a professional wage (or any wage).  Usually the weirdest jobs are character roles that an independent filmmaker or animator has created -- for instance, I just did the voice for a haunted house for a short film.  My character was a sentient, talking haunted house that basically was going senile, so it wanted to still be evil and cruel but it couldn't remember much anymore.  So, that was interesting.  That film hasn't been finished yet.  newlinechar    newlinechar  The strangest DIRECTION I've been given is another thing, though.  I had a client who was another independent director who wanted me to narrate his promo trailer video, and for one specific line, he told me all of the following:  newlinechar    newlinechar  Read it like you're a supervillain.  Read it like you're an evil cultist that is kind of maniacal and insane.  Read it like Mr. Rogers, but, like, almost like he's about to crack.  Read it like you're explaining your evil plan to James Bond.  Read it like you're Batman catching a criminal.  newlinechar    newlinechar  And I could go on.  Clients are usually weirder than the jobs are!

Yes totally!  It can be a very bad idea to start losing weight when you're not ready.   The ED will always take over,  and you'll never be satisfied.

&gt;Edit: and the mass would probably turn you into a black hole as well.  newlinechar    newlinechar  It actually wouldn't!  The Earth's Schwarzschild radius is about a centimeter (8.869 mm).  That means that you need an Earth-mass entirely contained within a sphere with a radius of about a centimeter for a black hole.  It doesn't have to start that way, but self-gravitation won't get you a black hole until you start talking about very massive stars (rather heavier than our own sun), so you'd have to have something else compressing it.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Meanwhile, a vanilla inventory full of osmium blocks is only a Titanic-mass (Schwarzschild radius: 7.7 \* 10^-20 m), and it is...oh, a player takes up more than one block, but not *all* of those blocks...we'll just call it a sphere a meter in diameter.  So that's about 19 orders of magnitude too large to form a black hole.  To get a Schwarzschild radius that large, you need about 3.4 \* 10^26 kg of mass.  In other words, you need 6.5 \* 10^18 such inventories in your inventory to become a black hole.  Even DSUs won't cut it here.

The number of people that I grew up with in which their parents didn't give a shit and they were just another write-off is fucking ridiculous. I've seen too many people with potential just kind of stop caring because their parents were shit and didn't really care about them. The entirety of the problem in the black community is that parents stop caring or never cared in the first place unless there is an opportunity for them to profit from their kids. And I don't know if it's intentional or if it's just what the kids feel when they only have a mom that has to work 2-3 jobs and doesn't have time for them but for a lot of the ones on welfare they also don't care about them. It's a tragedy. But even still that is no excuse to become a criminal and break the law. But I don't think that anyone is telling them this, the schools like to ignore this problem and the police just arrest them. There is no community support or sense of family.

There are a lot of ethnicities known for bigger noses, including Arabs, Persians and Italians (I have many friends from those ethnicities). I don't know, to each his/her own, I guess, but I think reshaping it through cosmetic surgery would not be very high on a list for what you can 'do better,' as you ask, since it's not disproportionate at all to your face.

Yes... it is her parents fault. But isn't the reason they were so strict and harsh with her because she told them she was trans?

It's not as easy as saying you are trans and getting the therapy... from what I have read, you have to spend up to 2 years with a therapist and meet a bunch of criteria to qualify for hormone therapy.

Not really to me.  I believe that she didn't believe Adnan did it at the time and might have accepted it since he was found guilty by a jury.  She didn't go to the trial, just the sentencing so, as many others, probably assumed the jury got it right.  Since the podcast and all of Jay's various versions of testimony have come to light, it wouldn't surprise me if she was back on the 'didn't do it' or 'unsure' train.  I would love to hear from her to know what she thinks now.  It is also interesting that there was an empty box with 'heart charm' on it found in Hae's car.  I would love to know if Jay gave Stephanie a heart charm bracelet for her birthday since we know he gave her a charm bracelet from his testimony at the time (even if he can't remember it now).

I would argue that the quality and album making ability from the Top Artists are a lot more consistent than UG. Kanye is Godly at production. Kendrick is one of the best lyricists of this generation. Drake is unparallelled at his ability to make Hooks and Bangers. All of these guys do a host of things well where UG artists might just be good in certain areas. There are some amazing lyricists who rap over garbage beats. There are some great producers who can't rap, or can't anyone decent on tracks. All of these guys do ever aspect of making rap songs well, and they do it consistently for multiple albums.   newlinechar    newlinechar  Also, in the age of the internet, mainstream is mainstream because its what most people fuck with.  This isn't the 90s where record companies have a monopoly on what everyone likes.  10 Years ago, artists like OF, Mac Miller, RTJ, Joey Bada$$, ASAP, FBZ, Chance, Kendrick would have never been as popular as they are now based one exposure. I think being a top artist now means more than ever because there is so much availability to get your stuff out there. If you have talent, make some good videos, and put out a couple good mixtapes/albums you can become a top artist.   newlinechar    newlinechar  I honestly think that right now, the top artists are the top for the reason that the majority of people think they're talented people who put out great work, not some record company entertainment puppet.

No, I absolutely agree that informed consent to suicide is a real thing that ought to be respected. But in general, queer suicides are produced by a vicious culture that systematically denies queers their identities or right to exist. If the culture shifted, many of the queers who are pushed to suicide would not make that choice. And to ignore that nuanced difference is to excuse hetero-patriarchy and its violent ramifications.

I somewhat agree with this and somewhat don't.  From what i've read (Salumi: The Craft of Italian Dry Curing), Rhulman claims that wet brines are best for infusing flavour of your herbs/spices/whatever.  newlinechar    newlinechar  These days i typically keep my dry brines pretty simple, because if I'm attempting to infuse flavour i will use a wet brine.    newlinechar    newlinechar  The main advantage of dry brines is that they are more effective at removing water mass.  So when you are making something that will dry cure, and you want to get lots of water out of it to start, dry brine is the way to go.  newlinechar    newlinechar  Also i often do both, especially with fish.  I will first dry brine to get a good cure.  Then i will wet brine to infuse some flavour.  newlinechar    newlinechar  But i do see your point about a wet brine diluting the maple syrup, which was my original point.  I do really like  /u/ebacklund's idea of using maple syrup concentrate.  But i would probably still do that with a dry brine.

Interesting then, that the Soviets never paid them for it. No, this was a stupid move aimed at 'improving relations with the Soviets'  newlinechar    newlinechar  Keen to thaw Anglo-Soviet relations, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee invited Soviet scientists and engineers to the Rolls-Royce jet facility to learn how the superior British engines were made. Attlee further offered to license production to the USSR—after exacting a solemn promise that the engines would be utilized only for non-military purposes. The offer stunned the Americans, who protested loudly. And the Soviets? Russian aviation historian and Ukrainian native Ilya Grinberg says, “Stalin himself couldn’t believe it. He said, ‘Who in their right mind would sell anything like this to us?’ ” Grinberg, a professor of technology at the State University of New York at Buffalo, points out that the presence in the delegation of Artem Mikoyan himself—the “Mi” in MiG—should have been a tip-off to what in fact ensued: The Rolls-Royce samples shipped to the USSR in 1946 were promptly installed into MiG-15 prototypes and successfully flight-tested. By the time the fighter was ready for mass production, the Soviets had reverse-engineered the Nene; their copy was designated the Klimov RD-45. When the British objected to the violation of their licensing agreement, says Grinberg, “the Russians just told them ‘Look, we incorporated a few changes. Now it qualifies as our own original design.’ ”  newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar  Read more: http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-jet-that-shocked-the-west-180947758/#CmObSEBQ0v0cDJUP.99  newlinechar  Save 47% when you subscribe to Air &amp; Space magazine http://bit.ly/NaSX4X  newlinechar  Follow us: @AirSpaceMag on Twitter  newlinechar    newlinechar  From the very beginning the design was a sequence of compromises. The axial-flow  newlinechar  Jumo copy, designated the RD-10, proved a poor choice, producing only 1,984lb  newlinechar  (900kg) of thrust. So a three-man delegation, including Mikoyan and engine designer  newlinechar  Vladimir Y. Klimov, went to the UK and acquired 25 centrifugal-flow Rolls-Royce  newlinechar  Nenes through the British Labour government’s socialist Board of Trade President and  newlinechar  ambassador to the USSR in 1940-42, Stafford Cripps. Reportedly, the British  newlinechar  government agreed to this sale on the condition that the engines would “not be used  newlinechar  for military purposes”. Ironically, the largest military use of any version of the Nene was  newlinechar  the Klimov RD-45. Additionally, Rolls-Royce later attempted to claim £207 million in  newlinechar  license fees from the Soviet government, but without success.   newlinechar    newlinechar  --MiG v.

Hmm... I would imagine a social scientist, such as an evolutionary psychologist, might argue that taking offense to a personal slight, whether real or imagined, and the responses thereafter (whether that's being aggressive or assertive towards the offender in an attempt to extinguish future occurrences of the offending behavior *or* modifying the offended person's behavior [e.g. not hanging out with the offender *or* changing one's behavior to comply with the offender's social expectations of the offended person]) would have evolutionary advantages.  newlinechar    newlinechar  If one's social status is being threatened by offending actors, there's an evolutionary advantage for us as humans to preserve our social statuses by having an emotional response to offending behavior and extinguishing that offending behavior in one form or another (as previously discussed).   newlinechar    newlinechar  Most people's (if not all people) lives depend on their social status (e.g. if someone didn't find you at least somewhat dependable, [or at least breathing] you wouldn't have a job at Arby's).  newlinechar    newlinechar  *drops cherry from cigarette onto New Year's Eve dress shirt and burns hole in said shirt while aggressively trying to brush off burning cherry...then lighting new cigarette as if nothing happened*  newlinechar    newlinechar  That's why I admire your ability to not be offended... you defy the tides of evolution... at least in that way...

My girlfriend's mom didn't like me dating her daughter (probably because I was 18 and she was 16). She'd always lie to her mom about where she was going when we would get together.

One afternoon, we were in the middle of an intense make-out session in a booth at the back of the arcade/pizza place. My girlfriend's friend interrupted us in the middle of a handy to say that the mom was coming in to look for her, so I bailed out the back door. I walked around to the end of the strip mall just in time to see my girlfriend walking out with her mom, so I ducked back around the corner and finished the job that she started.

Thanks for being understanding— it's hard to convey what I'm trying to say over the internet without coming across as condescending, but I really don't mean it that way. It's not fair that victims of assault are forced to relive their painful memories time and time again when confronted with the ignorance of people who can't empathize with what it's like. But I'm trying to say is that through alienating those people, we are only hurting ourselves even more. To put it bluntly, every time a friend puts us down or doesn't take sensitivity to triggers seriously, the madman who caused our trauma has gained another victory. You're absolutely right that victims should never have to suffer because of the unintended ignorance of other people, and to stand up to this ignorance is certainly a righteous cause, but don't destroy yourself by giving everything up for the fight. Outsiders just don't understand what we've been through, and there's often just not much we can do to correct that ignorance without hurting our relationship with them. All I'm saying is be wise about how to handle issues like this. Sometime's it's not worth losing a friend over.

Would of been the biggest mistake of you're gaming experience if you didn't have a second attempt. As I said I played fallout 3 when I was much younger, I really couldn't make sense of anything. But after fallout new vegas I love the world. I was early teens when I got new vegas and with my being older and turning into an adult I see myself becoming more understanding of characters and their motives and a lot more empathy for protagonists. Im thinking about doing another play through of new vegas but I had done every possible but it might be fun to do it again with a second view of the game

The tidal acceleration in LEO due to the Sun is about 5*10^-7 m/s^(2).  That comes out to about 3 mm/s of delta-v for one orbital period, or 1 m/s over 20 days.  The tidal acceleration due to the Moon is about 10^-6 m/s^(2).  The Earth's own equatorial bulge is the largest secondary orbital effect, but the pull of the Sun and Moon still matter over longer time periods.

&gt;Why do you have to keep living in a city where you have no friends and no job?  newlinechar    newlinechar  Because it's in a much safer and nicer place (Murca), and it's far away from my mother. The plan was always to move here as a family but then dad died and all the plans went strange, I ended up being the only one who moved. Like I said, long story. It's hard for me to consider to move back here because I have a bunch of stuff there, and it would basically be a downgrade. It took a lot of courage to move there at all, I was just 19. It'd be easier to get a car, a GED and a job than to move back. It's hard for me to be a self starter because of how my mother sat at the table with me to supervise me do homework and went into hysterics and hit on the table and threw shit if I did a mistake or complained etc. This was basically every day and most days I was in tears. I have associated doing work with being forced and treated like shit, so it's hard, but if I put the work in I don't need to move back.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I do have friends here, and it's actually the only reason why I accepted the invitation to come is to see them (including my best friend who is also visiting!), but I'm too shy to basically invite myself into their and their family's plans. Will see them after new year for sure though.  newlinechar    newlinechar  I seriously doubt I have depression, my understanding is that there's also an element of being elated after being completely sad, which isn't really the case for me, I'm just cruising along fine 95% of the time.

The fits of rage, job instability and moving frequently were the traits I saw primarily through sociopathy. I can't be sure if the fits of rage/outrage he displayed were primarily a mask or if he actually felt them as he's been dead for two centuries.

It's my understanding from my wife that clinical areas are almost exclusively nurse only. Because the hospital in House had a free clinic, it would seem that as a courtesy they may put doctors or possibly new resident (new doctors  fresh out of med school) there for learning purposes. I think in House's case, his clinic duty was a punishment due to his bad attitude, which is possible but probably really rare.

Had more to do with mountainous terrain, battle worthiness and supply thorough put than defensiveness. Germany built ever increasingly massive tanks when they were put on the defensive and even Japan built decent numbers of relatively heavier tanks for defense of the home islands.    newlinechar    newlinechar  When you have to supply remote bases in China or far flung pacific islands, you need to have weapons that require little supply and are easy to maintain, hence the tiny Japanese battle lawnmowers.

Majoroutage is correct: a vasectomy can be reversed by a vasovasostomy, which creates a new opening of the vas deferens to reconnect it. A salpingosalpingostomy for women rejoins the fallopian tubes. So sterilization isn't a permanent option.

The point of it is really to induce readers to question who is really accountable for the deaths created by anti-queer culture. I don't think the authors of this poster are aiming at indicting everyone who ever called their friend a fag for every queer suicide ever. It's a metaphorical device in one sense, but also a concrete account of who is responsible at the same time. People get hype about the word 'murder' (when people say Darren Wilson is a murderer, meat is murder, etc) but murder is a social construct. the legal system has a very narrow definition of murder. But the same way, in ecology there is point source (factory x pollutes the river) and non-point source (there are so many factories on this river we don't know who did it, if any one - more likely, many contributed) pollution, there seems to be a functional non-point source murder.   newlinechar    newlinechar  &gt;That doesn't mean that I don't care about queer teens.

Both sides want to accomplish their own political agendas. That means overpowering the other side. And politicians aren't exactly known for thinking long term. If one side sees an oppurtunity to give their leader more power they will take it, even if it means potentially giving the other side more power in the next election.

Firstly, light years are a unit of distance, not time, secondly, to age well an album has to not sound dated after a longer period of time than 3 years, it should probably survive at least one MAJOR sound shift, or 'paradigm change' for lack of a better term, in the genre, and I don't see how that's the case with LiveLove yet  newlinechar  When it's been 7-10 years I might agree

Mr. Krabs simply could not satisfy his overwhelming greed via the Krusty Krab. This led him to loan money from many loan sharks in order to simply obtain more.

That's because the five year timeline was a marketing strategy to draw in new readers who would otherwise be intimidated by decades of canon history. Now that the New 52 is no longer 'new', editorial shackles have been loosened, and writers are going back and retconning portions of that five year history as they see fit. It's really not that different from writers in 2009 retconning details that happened a decade before.
